# Guild Release — stamp the changelog and tag a version

Finalize completed guild requirements into a versioned release: stamp `CHANGELOG.md`'s
Unreleased section with a version, record the release on the board, and create an annotated
git tag.

Status is a **column**. There are no status directories, no ticket files, and no per-requirement
snapshot — a release copies nothing and moves nothing; the board and `CHANGELOG.md` are the whole
record. Load `guild:warehouse` before the first query.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
DB=.guild/guild.db
```

**Backend.** `backend:` in `.guild/config.yaml` — absent means `local`, and the SQL below is the
local path. On `kumiai` every board read and write is a tool call against `workspace` from the
config, with `actor: "orchestrator"` (`guild:warehouse` → `references/kumiai.md`); each step
names its call. The CHANGELOG and git steps are identical in both.

## Arguments

- `--dry-run` — print the full plan, write nothing, run no git command
- `--only REQ-NNN[,REQ-MMM]` — release only the named requirements (default: every `done`
  requirement not already recorded in a previous release)

## Step 1 — preconditions

Run in parallel:
- `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — confirm a repo
- `git status --short` — uncommitted changes
- `git tag --list --sort=-v:refname` — existing tags
- `[ -f .guild/config.yaml ]` — confirm the guild exists

Stop conditions:
- Not a git repo → `Not inside a git repository. Guild release requires git.`
- No `.guild/config.yaml` → `No guild found. Nothing to release.`
- Uncommitted changes → ask, and default to stopping on "no":
  ```
  You have uncommitted changes. A release should be a clean point in history.
  Continue anyway? (yes / no)
  ```

## Step 2 — what is in scope

A release is **recorded on the board**, in `guild_state` under `release:<version>`, so "what has
already shipped" is a query rather than a directory scan:

```sql
SELECT r.id, r.title
  FROM requirement r
 WHERE r.status = 'done'
   AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM guild_state gs, json_each(gs.value, '$.requirements') j
                    WHERE gs.key LIKE 'release:%' AND json_valid(gs.value) AND j.value = r.id)
 ORDER BY r.id;
```

On `kumiai`: `list {type: "requirement", where: {status: "done"}}`, then `list {type:
"guild_state", where: {key: {op: "like", value: "release:%"}}}` — each value is the same JSON, so a
requirement already in some release's `requirements` array is out of scope. Page both until
`next_offset` is `null`.

With `--only`, use exactly the named ids instead — and verify each is `done` before including it.

Empty set → stop with `No completed requirements to release since the last release.`

**Exclude the standing QA umbrella.** It is `in-progress` forever by design, so the query above
already skips it; do not add it by hand under `--only`.

## Step 3 — the pre-release gate

For every requirement in scope, one query answers the whole gate:

```sql
SELECT id, status, tasks_total, tasks_done, tasks_open, tasks_blocked, tasks_failed,
       replace(replace(title, char(10), ' '), '|', '!') AS title
  FROM v_requirement_progress
 WHERE id IN ('REQ-007','REQ-008');
```

(kumiai: `read_view {view: "v_requirement_progress", where: {id: ["REQ-007","REQ-008"]}}`, and
`v_failed_tasks` the same way with `where: {requirement_id: [...]}`.)

**Warn, never block.** Two different warnings, and the difference matters:

- `tasks_failed > 0` — a human already ruled on these. Distinguish the waived ones, because a
  waiver is a decision and a bare failure is not:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, waived, replace(replace(COALESCE(reason,'-'), char(10),' '), '|','!') AS reason, title
    FROM v_failed_tasks WHERE requirement_id IN ('REQ-007');
  ```
  ```
  These tasks for included requirements failed:
    TASK-013: {title}  (waived by you)
    TASK-021: {title}  (failed, not waived — {reason})
  The release will note them. Continue? (yes / no)
  ```

- `tasks_open > 0` — still `todo`, `in-progress`, **or `blocked`**. A blocked one is the loud
  case: it means nobody on the roster could take it, so the requirement is shipping work
  nobody ever attempted. Name it as such:

  ```
  These tasks for included requirements are not done:
    TASK-030: {title} (todo)
    TASK-031: {title} (BLOCKED — no eligible agent)
  They stay on the board after release. Continue? (yes / no)
  ```

## Step 4 — the version

1. Find the latest semver tag (`vX.Y.Z`). None → suggest `v0.1.0`.
2. Show current version, the requirements in scope with their titles, and ask `What version?`
3. Validate against `v\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[A-Za-z0-9.]+)?`. Re-prompt on invalid.
4. Reject a version whose tag already exists, **and** one already present as a
   `release:<version>` key on the board — either means this version was already cut
   (kumiai: `get_state {key: "release:<version>"}` returns a row).

## Step 5 — CHANGELOG.md

The changelog lives at **repo root**, not inside `.guild/`.

If it does not exist, create it with the Keep-a-Changelog skeleton and an empty
`## [Unreleased]`. If it exists without an `## [Unreleased]`, insert one after the preamble,
before the first `## [version]` heading. If `[Unreleased]` is empty and `--only` was not used,
warn: `The [Unreleased] section is empty. Release anyway? (yes / no)`

Then transform it:

1. Capture everything under `## [Unreleased]` up to the next `## ` heading or EOF —
   `UNRELEASED_BODY`.
2. With `--only`, keep only the bullets referencing the included REQ ids; move the rest back
   under `## [Unreleased]`.
3. For each in-scope requirement not already mentioned, append `- REQ-NNN: {title}`. Flatten the
   title first (`replace(replace(title, char(10),' '), '|','!')`) — **a newline inside a title
   would forge a changelog bullet, or worse, a heading.**
4. Replace the heading block with a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]`, then
   `## [{version}] - {today}` carrying `UNRELEASED_BODY`.

## Step 6 — record the release on the board

This is what makes Step 2 a query next time, and it is the only board write a release makes:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
UPDATE guild_state SET value = 'orchestrator' WHERE key = 'actor';

INSERT INTO guild_state (key, value)
VALUES ('release:v1.2.0',
        json_object('released', date('now'),
                    'requirements', json_array('REQ-007','REQ-008')))
ON CONFLICT(key) DO UPDATE SET value = excluded.value
RETURNING key, value;
```

On `kumiai`, call `fingerprint {workspace}` first and keep the result (Step 9 compares it), then
write the record — the same key and the same JSON value — and one explicit event so the feed says
a release happened, since Kumiai's feed is what the team reads in its UI:

```json
set_state    {"workspace": "<ws>", "actor": "orchestrator", "key": "release:v1.2.0",
              "value": "{\"released\":\"2026-10-18\",\"requirements\":[\"REQ-007\",\"REQ-008\"]}"}
record_event {"workspace": "<ws>", "actor": "orchestrator", "verb": "released",
              "subject_type": "release", "subject_id": "v1.2.0",
              "payload": {"requirements": ["REQ-007", "REQ-008"]}}
```

`value` is a string holding JSON, exactly as the local column is TEXT holding JSON. `set_state`
is an upsert, so re-running after a failed hook is still safe. **These are the only two writes**
— no `update_requirement`, no status move.

**A release never changes a requirement's status and never deletes a row.** `done` requirements
cost nothing on the board — `v_next_task` only ever looks at open tasks — and deleting them would
orphan every work log, finding and event that explains how the release was built. Nor is there
anywhere to hand that job off to: **nothing in the guild deletes records** (G11), so a board that
reads as crowded is one to narrow with `guild:brief` and priorities, not one to empty.

## Step 7 — commit and tag

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(release): {version}

Release {N} requirement(s):
{one bullet per REQ}
EOF
)"
git tag -a {version} -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Release {version}

{UNRELEASED_BODY content}
EOF
)"
```

Do NOT push. Do NOT pass `--no-verify`.

If pre-commit hooks fail, surface the error and stop. The board row is already recorded, but
nothing was moved or deleted — re-running the release after fixing the hook is safe, because
Step 6's write is an upsert and Step 2 will then find the scope already released and say so.

## Step 8 — report

```
Released {version}
==================

Changelog: CHANGELOG.md (new [{version}] section)
Board:     guild_state['release:{version}'] records what shipped
  {N} requirement(s) — plans, tasks, work logs, findings and bugs stay on the board

  Released requirements stay on the live board as `done`. Nothing was deleted.

Git:
  Commit {short-hash}: chore(release): {version}
  Tag: {version}

Not pushed. Push with:
  git push && git push --tags
```

## Step 9 — verify against §9

Run `guild:validate release` (kumiai: `check_invariants {process: "release"}`, and §9.a is
`fingerprint {workspace}` taken before Step 6 and again after it — the only differences permitted
are the one `guild_state` row and the one `released` event). §9 of
`docs/expectations.md` follows from one sentence — a
release *records*, it does not retire: §9.a fingerprints the board before and after and the
**only** difference permitted is the one `guild_state` row, §9.b that the release record is
well-formed and no requirement was released twice or released while not done. **Report every
failure with its rows.** Under `--dry-run`, §9.a's diff must be empty.

## Dry-run mode

With `--dry-run`, run steps 1–5 to build the plan and print it: the version, the requirements in
scope with their titles, the CHANGELOG transformation, and the git actions that would run — plus
every warning from the pre-release gate. **Write no file, run no git command, and make no board
write.** The step-2, step-3 and step-4 queries are all reads and are safe to run; step 6's upsert
is not, and must not run.

## Rules

- **Never push** — the user decides when to publish a tag.
- **Never skip hooks** — no `--no-verify`.
- **Never delete or restatus a released requirement.** A release records; it does not retire.
- **`-m list`, always** (local). The default `pretty` output mode truncates long values with an ellipsis,
  and a truncated title is a lie that outlives the release.
- **Flatten free text before it becomes structure.** A newline in a title forges a changelog
  bullet or a heading; `replace(replace(x, char(10),' '), '|','!')` in SQL, before it leaves the
  engine.
- **Check every query's exit code.** Errors arrive on stdout and would otherwise be read as
  content.
- **IDs are derived, never counters** — nothing is reset at a release.
- **CHANGELOG.md lives at repo root**, not inside `.guild/`.
- **`doc`, `doc_revision`, `knowledge_edge`, `coverage`, `.guild/docs/` and `.guild/qa/` are
  evergreen** — a release never touches them. Plans, tasks, work logs, findings and bugs stay on
  the board; a release names requirements and decision slugs, it does not copy their contents.
- **One commit, one tag**, both created in step 7.
