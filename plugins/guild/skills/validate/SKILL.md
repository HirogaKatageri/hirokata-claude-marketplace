  "check the board against expectations", or wants to know whether what a skill just

# Validating the guild

There is no code left to unit-test. What can fail now is a member reading the schema and
the process, understanding some of it, and doing something **adjacent** to what was needed.

`docs/expectations.md` is the specification that catches that, and because the data model is
a database, every expectation in it is a **SQL assertion with a stated expected result**
rather than prose to be interpreted. This skill runs them and reports what holds.

**Read-only by default, and say so in the report.** The only path that writes is
`--fixture`, which is gated behind a confirmation and refuses a board holding real work.

## The surface

| invocation | what runs |
|---|---|
| `validate` | §3 — the eleven global invariants. They hold whatever just ran. |
| `validate <process>` | §3, then that process's preconditions, postconditions and anti-expectations. |
| `validate --fixture <name>` | Loads a fixture into a **scratch** database, then asserts against it. Writes. |

`<process>` names a skill, and the section it maps to:

| process | section | process | section |
|---|---|---|---|
| `new-requirement` | §4 the build flow | `release` | §9 |
| `brief` | §5 | `qa` | §10 the maintenance cycle |
| `dashboard` | §6 | `shift` | §11 the unattended shift |
| `check-in` | §7 | | |

§8 names no process: it is the anti-expectations for emptying a board, and the fresh-file
procedure that stands in for one. Its assertion, *nothing was deleted*, is **G11** and runs
with every other global.

`<name>` is one of `empty`, `planned`, `in-flight`, `review-ready`, `messy`, `maintenance` —
`docs/expectations-fixtures.md`.

## Which backend

`backend:` in `.guild/config.yaml` — absent means `local`, and everything below *Running it*
is the local path. **On `kumiai` the assertions run server-side**: Kumiai implements the same
`docs/expectations.md` against its Postgres copy of the warehouse, so this skill extracts
nothing and calls one tool instead:

```json
check_invariants {"workspace": "<ws>"}                            // validate            → §3
check_invariants {"workspace": "<ws>", "process": "check-in"}     // validate <process> → §3 + its section
check_invariants {"workspace": "<ws>", "process": "new-requirement", "requirement": "REQ-007"}
→ {"ok": false,
   "failures": [{"id": "G5", "description": "ticket routing",
                 "rows": [["no-pin-no-capabilities", "TASK-010", "todo"]]}],
   "checked": ["G1", …], "skipped": [{"id": "P4.b", "reason": "…"}, …]}
```

`process` takes the same names as the table above; `new-requirement` also needs `requirement`
(§4 is per requirement — `VALIDATION` without it). `failures[].rows` are the offending rows the
SQL would have printed — report them **verbatim**, in the same report shape as below, and name the
target as the Kumiai workspace rather than `.guild/guild.db`. `ok: true` with no failures is the
zero-rows pass. A failure carrying `"advisory": true` (§9.c) leaves `ok` true — report it as the
warning it is. `skipped` lists every assertion that stays local, with its reason: report those as
*not run here*, never as passed.

What does not move to the server, because it is not on the board:

- **§6 (dashboard)** asserts over the built `.guild/dashboard.html`, and **§11.f** over git. Run
  those blocks locally exactly as written — they are `grep` and `git`, not board SQL.
- **§4's `REQ-NNN`** is the `requirement` parameter: `check_invariants {process:
  "new-requirement", requirement: "REQ-007"}`.
- **§9.a's before/after fingerprint** is `fingerprint {workspace}`, taken by `guild:release`
  before its writes and after; this skill compares the two the release hands it.
- **`--fixture`** stays local in both backends — fixtures are SQL seeds, and they load into a
  scratch `tursodb` file, never into a Kumiai workspace.

## The shape every assertion has

**Zero rows when healthy, the offending rows when not**, so a failure names its own cause.
`finding-open-past-gate-repairs|1|REQ-001` tells you the row, the requirement and the rule;
a boolean `FAIL` tells you to go looking. **Any output at all is a failure.**

A handful state a count or a value instead — §4.b expects exactly the plan gate row, §4.c
expects `N+10 | 2N+11 | 2`, P4.a expects version `8`. The sentence above each block says
which. Read it; do not assume the zero-rows shape.

**The exit code is not evidence.** tursodb has no `-bail`, a failing statement does not stop
a script, and errors print on **stdout**. Check the return code *and* the output, every time.

## Running it

**The doc is the source.** Never retype an assertion and never paraphrase one — a second
copy of a rule is exactly the failure this document exists to catch. Extract it.

````bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
DOC="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/expectations.md"
DB=.guild/guild.db
WORK=$(mktemp -d)

for g in G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 G7 G8 G9; do
  awk -v id="$g" '$0 ~ "^### " id " " {f=1}
                  f && /^```sql$/ {c=1; next}
                  c && /^```$/ {exit}
                  c {print}' "$DOC" > "$WORK/$g.sql"
  out=$(tursodb -q -m list "$DB" < "$WORK/$g.sql" 2>&1); rc=$?
  if [ $rc -eq 0 ] && [ -z "$out" ]; then printf '%s PASS\n' "$g"
  else printf '%s FAIL rc=%s\n%s\n' "$g" "$rc" "$out"; fi
done
````

A section assertion extracts the same way, keyed on its bold id. `REQ-NNN` in §4 is a
placeholder — substitute the requirement actually under test:

````bash
awk -v id="4.a" 'index($0, "**§"id" ") {f=1}
                 f && /^```sql$/ {c=1; next}
                 c && /^```$/ {exit}
                 c {print}' "$DOC" | sed 's/REQ-NNN/REQ-001/g' > "$WORK/s4a.sql"
````

Preconditions (`P4.a`, `P7.b`, …) live inside their section's single fenced block; extract
the block by its `### Preconditions` heading and run it whole.

## Reporting

Name the target, name the sections, and state the read-only fact first:

```
Validated .guild/guild.db against §3 + §7 (check-in) — READ-ONLY, nothing was written.

  G1  referential health   PASS      G6  closure and records  PASS
  …
  G5  ticket routing       FAIL      G9  concurrency          PASS

  G5 — ticket routing
      no-pin-no-capabilities|TASK-010

1 of 9 invariants failed. TASK-010 names no member and declares no capabilities, so there is
no question the dispatcher can answer — it will sit on the board forever.

Not checked here: whether a declared capability is one some agent file actually
declares. The roster is not in the database, so no SQL assertion can reach it —
`roster.py --covers` is the check, and it is the strategist's to run at plan time.
```

- **Print the offending rows verbatim.** Never compress a failure into a count; the rows
  are the whole value of the assertion's shape.
- **Read the breach token,** then say in one line what it means for the board and what
  closes it. A validation nobody can act on is a validation nobody runs twice.
- **Close a fully-passing run with what was not checked.** Every section has a *Cannot be
  asserted* heading and it is not decoration: nothing here sees whether a plan is good,
  whether the code was written, whether a human actually decided a gate, or who wrote a row.
  Say that once, plainly, rather than letting green read as proof.

## The fixture path — this one writes

`validate --fixture messy` seeds a known board so an assertion means the same thing twice.
Four things are mandatory:

1. **Never load into `.guild/guild.db`.** The target is a scratch file — `$(mktemp -d)/fx.db`
   — with `schema.sql` applied. If the user insists on a named target, run the guard below
   first and **refuse** if it returns anything, naming the tables that hold work:

   ```sql
   SELECT 'goal' AS tbl, CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) AS rows FROM goal HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'requirement', CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM requirement HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'task',        CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM task        HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'bug',         CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM bug         HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'coverage',    CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM coverage    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'doc',         CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM doc         HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'knowledge_edge', CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM knowledge_edge HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'doc_revision', CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM doc_revision HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'inspection',  CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM inspection  HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   UNION ALL SELECT 'event',       CAST(COUNT(*) AS TEXT) FROM event       HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
   ORDER BY tbl;
   ```

   Zero rows means the file is safe to overwrite.
2. **Confirm before loading**, naming the exact file that will be written. This is the one
   path in this skill that is not read-only and the user is told so before it runs.
3. **Load in order.** The chains are §0.1 of `expectations-fixtures.md`:
   `empty` = schema only · `planned` = `00`+`02` · `in-flight` = +`03` ·
   `review-ready` = +`04` · `messy` = `00`,`02`,`03`,`05` · `maintenance` = `00`,`06`.
   Extract each seed block by its `**Seed SQL — \`NN-name.sql\`:**` line, same awk.
4. **Check both channels after every load, then run the fixture's sanity query** and compare
   it to the stated result. Every seed script is silent on success, so *any* output is an
   error; `schema.sql` alone prints `wal`. A script can exit 0 having written half of what
   it meant to — the sanity row is what proves it did not.

## Rules

- **Read-only unless `--fixture`,** and the report says which it was.
- **The doc is the source.** If an assertion is wrong, fix `docs/expectations.md` — do not
  correct it inline here and do not carry a private copy.
- **Any output is a failure.** Check the return code *and* stdout, always.
- **Never `cut -d'|'` the result.** Board text carries pipes and newlines, and a newline
  forges a whole row (`guild:warehouse`, rule 4).
- **Never write the board to make an assertion pass.** Report the breach; repairing it is a
  separate, named decision by the guild master.
- **A green run is not a good run.** It says the member did not break the board's rules. It
  says nothing about whether the work was worth doing — that is the *Cannot be asserted*
  list, and it belongs in the report.
