# The `standard` template — build a requirement

**You are the strategist. There is no parser.** You read this page and you write the
`graph_node` / `graph_edge` / `gate` rows yourself, with the SQL at the bottom.

**Shape:** approve the plan, then run to completion.

```
gate-plan ─▶ implement (× tickets) ─▶ test-plan ─▶ test-write ─▶ review (× 4) ─▶ gate-repairs ─▶ repair ─▶ document
   GATE                                                                            GATE
   └──────────────── segment 1: runs without stopping ──────────────┘              └───── segment 2 ─────┘
```

Use it for every requirement that produces work. Despite the code-shaped node names, `implement`
is any producing ticket — code, an article, a diagram — and **the test and review steps are not
assumed**: the strategist decides at Step 3.7 which of them this requirement needs, and a step
that is not needed is kept in the graph and marked `skipped` (§5.1). For inspecting code that
already exists, use [`maintenance.md`](maintenance.md) instead.

## 1. The node sequence

| # | node key | kind | after | fan-out | may run in parallel | required |
|---|----------|------|-------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| 1 | `gate-plan` | gate | — | none, always one | n/a | yes |
| 2 | `implement` | work | `gate-plan` | one node **per implement ticket** | tickets sharing a `parallel_group` | yes |
| 3 | `test-plan` | work | `implement` (all of them) | none, always one | no | no — skipped when verification is `none` |
| 4 | `test-write` | work | `test-plan` | one **anchor**, tickets underneath | no | no — skipped when verification is `checks` or `none` |
| 5 | `review` | work | `test-write` | **fixed at 4 named reviewers** | all four together | no — skipped, wholly or in part, by the assurance decision |
| 6 | `gate-repairs` | gate | `review` (all four) | none, always one | n/a | yes |
| 7 | `repair` | work | `gate-repairs` | one **anchor**, tickets underneath | tickets sharing a `parallel_group` | no |
| 8 | `document` | work | `repair` | none, always one | no | yes |

With *N* implement tickets that is **N + 10 nodes and 2N + 11 edges**. Two tickets → 12 nodes, 15
edges, 2 gate rows. That is the number to check your INSERT against.

---

## 2. What each node produces

### `gate-plan` — the only approval before anything is built

Prompt: `Plan for {requirement} is ready for review. Approve implementation?`
Gate kind: `approve`.

Produces nothing. It *is* the decision. Everything downstream — how many tickets, which
reviewers, what gets tested — was already written by the time this gate is presented; the guild
master is approving a plan they can read, not authorizing an unknown.

The plan is the cheapest place to change your mind. One decision here redirects the entire
requirement. That is why it is the first node and why there is no second chance to redirect
before `gate-repairs`.

### `implement` — one node per implement ticket

Capability: `implement`. Produces: **working code and a passing build for one ticket.**

Fan-out is `per-task`: read the requirement's tickets where `node_key = 'implement'` and emit one
node per ticket, id `REQ-NNN/implement.<TASK-ID>`. Each node binds that ticket and inherits its
`parallel_group`.

**The one guard that is not obvious.** If the plan has no implement tickets yet — which is the
state every board is in for the first few minutes — emit **one unfanned node**
`REQ-NNN/implement` instead.
The two INSERTs below are mutually exclusive by construction. Never let a template key end up
with zero rows; see §5.

### `test-plan` — the barrier

Capability: `test-planning`. Produces: **a test declaration** — which behaviours need covering,
at what level, in how many specs.

It waits for **every** `implement.<TASK-ID>` node, because it inventories the whole diff. That is
what the cross-join edge INSERT gives you for free: one statement, `implement` × `test-plan`,
and a fanned predecessor becomes a real barrier.

### `test-write` — one anchor, not one node per spec

Capability: `test-authoring`. Produces: **the test files.**

Nominally `per-declaration` — the test-planner says how many. **It still instantiates as exactly
one node.** No command materializes siblings at run time; the anchor is the barrier and the
tickets are the work. The orchestrator dispatches every ticket the anchor covers and moves the
anchor `done` once.

**Why the anchor must exist even with nothing under it yet.** `review` is `after: [test-write]`.
With zero `test-write` rows there is no edge into `review`, so `review` has no unfinished direct
predecessor — and the readiness rule (§7) says it is **immediately ready**. Review would run
before a single test was written. The anchor is what stops that.

### `review` — four reviewers, fixed, in parallel

Produces: **`review_finding` rows.** No code is changed here.

Fan-out is `fixed` with four named agents:

| agent | reads for |
|---|---|
| `reviewer-security` | injection, authz, secrets, unsafe deserialization |
| `reviewer-architecture` | layering, coupling, whether it matches the plan |
| `reviewer-business-logic` | does it do what the requirement said |
| `reviewer-edge-case` | nulls, empties, boundaries, concurrency, failure paths |

All four get `parallel_group = 'review'` so the batch query puts them in one wave. They read the
same diff and write to different rows; there is no contention.

### `gate-repairs` — report problems, approve repairs

Prompt: `Findings and bugs from {requirement} — approve which get repaired.`
Gate kind: `select-findings` — the guild master picks a subset, and the selection is stored in
`gate.decision`.

**Problems found during the run are collected, not escalated one at a time.** A failing task, a
security finding and a flaky test all wait here and surface together, where they can be judged
against each other in one pass. Escalating each one the moment it appears converts agent time
into the guild master's time, which is the resource the whole template is built to protect.

### `repair` — one anchor, tickets underneath

Capability: `implement`. Produces: **fixes for the approved findings only.**

Nominally `per-approved-finding`; same anchor rule as `test-write`. Tickets inherit the
`parallel_group` of the ticket they repair, so disjoint repairs still run concurrently.

### `document` — the requirement writes itself down

Capability: `document`. Produces: **typed `doc` rows, and the `knowledge_edge` rows that link
them to this requirement.**

**It runs last, after `repair`, because documentation of a moving target is waste.** By this
point the code is final, the reviewers have spoken and the guild master has ruled on what gets
fixed — so what the librarian writes is what actually shipped, including the findings that were
deliberately waived, which are among the most useful things a future reader can learn.

It reads the requirement, the plan, the **gate decisions**, the review findings, the
`graph_deviation` reasons and the diff, then writes at most four things: the domain rules this
work established (`business`), how the subsystem now works (`technical`), each choice that a
reasonable engineer could have made differently (`decision`), and any operation somebody will
have to perform (`runbook`). Requirements that produced none of those get a work-log line saying
so, which takes a minute and is a legitimate outcome — see the note on `required` below.

**Why it is `required: true`.** A node that may be dropped is a node that gets dropped, and the
cost is invisible for months and then enormous. The strategist may still RESHAPE it — a
docs-only requirement might route it to a single `technical` update — but "we'll write it up
later" is not a reshape, and there is no later.

**It is the only node that writes to the library**, which is why nothing before it needs to
remember to. The researcher and the strategist still write `doc` rows as they go (research
findings, decisions taken at plan time); the librarian's job is the sweep at the end that
catches what they did not.

---

## 3. What may run at the same time

`parallel_group` is a **label, not a strategy**. Nodes ready at the same instant and carrying
the same non-null label form one batch. A NULL label means "run me alone".

| node | label written at instantiation | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `implement.<TASK-ID>` | the implement ticket's own `parallel_group` | tickets the strategist declared disjoint run together |
| `review.<agent>` | the literal `'review'` | all four reviewers in one wave |
| everything else | `NULL` | serial |

`document` is deliberately in "everything else". It runs alone, after everything, and it is the
last thing the requirement does.

**The disjointness assertion belongs to the strategist, not to the database.** `task.files`
is where you record which files a ticket owns; if two tickets share a file, give them different
`parallel_group` values and they serialize. Nothing in the schema checks this for you. If you
are unsure, use different groups — a wrong serialization costs time, a wrong parallelization
costs a merge conflict inside an unattended shift.

---

## 4. Exactly two gates, and their placement is the point

`standard` declares **two** gates and no more. That number is not a default.

- **Dropping one** removes the guild master's control surface. The obvious failure mode; it
  reads as an attack.
- **Adding one** reads as caution — *"I'd like to check in before the migrations run"* — and is
  the more expensive mistake. Gates are the boundary at which an unattended shift stops and
  notifies. A third gate quietly converts a shift that runs overnight into a session that stops
  every twenty minutes waiting for a human who is asleep. The cost is not paid at the moment of
  the decision, which is why there is no reason good enough.

Two gates means a requirement is exactly **two segments**: `implement → review`, and `repair`.
Each compiles to one workflow.

**Why gates cannot live inside a workflow.** Subagents cannot call `AskUserQuestion`; only the
orchestrator session can. A generated workflow physically cannot ask anything. Segmenting at
gates is the only shape that preserves guild-master control.

---

## 5. Deviation rules — and why each one exists

The strategist may deviate from this template. Every deviation writes a `graph_deviation` row
carrying a **non-empty reason**.

```sql
INSERT INTO graph_deviation (requirement_id, kind, node_key, reason, created_at)
VALUES ('REQ-007', 'add-node', 'research',
        CAST(x'<hex of the reason>' AS TEXT), datetime('now'));
```

`kind` is one of `add-node`, `drop-node`, `reshape`, `add-gate`.

| rule | why |
|---|---|
| A `required: true` node may be **reshaped but never dropped** | `gate-plan`, `implement`, `gate-repairs` and `document` are the guild's standards, not a per-requirement judgement. |
| **`test-plan`, `test-write` and `review` may be SKIPPED, never deleted — and only with a `graph_deviation` row carrying the reason** | Whether work needs tests or review is a judgement about *this deliverable*, and the guild master reads it at `gate-plan`. The node stays and is marked `skipped`; a deleted node is an unexplained hole. G8 asserts the row exists. |
| **A gate may be neither dropped nor added** | §4. `add-gate` is refused outright, whatever the reason. |
| **Every deviation carries a non-empty reason** | Whitespace-only is empty. A graph with unexplained divergence cannot be diffed against a baseline when a run goes wrong — you end up staring at a bespoke graph with no way to tell intent from accident. |
| **An `add-node` must name a capability some available subagent declares** | Otherwise you get a graph that cannot run: a node nobody can be matched to, discovered at dispatch time in the middle of a shift. **Nothing in SQL can check this** — the roster is the agent files. Check with `roster.py --covers` before you insert (§8). |
| **Every template key gets at least one node** | This is what makes "dropped" unambiguous. A key with zero rows was dropped — full stop, with no *"unless its fan-out happened to be empty"* caveat to hide behind. It is also why `implement` has a no-tickets fallback and why the anchors exist. |

**Legitimate deviations look like:** a `research` node ahead of `implement` for an unfamiliar
API; skipping `test-plan` and `test-write` for an article whose rules the author checks with the
site's own commands; skipping the security and architecture reviewers on a draft with no input,
secrets or structure; fanning `review` to six with a performance and an accessibility reviewer for
a UI-heavy requirement; splitting `implement` into three sequential waves because the file sets
are not disjoint.

### 5.1 Skipping a step on the assurance decision

The strategist asks, at Step 3.7, whether each ticket needs tests and whether it needs review. The
answers decide which of `test-plan`, `test-write` and the four `review.*` nodes run.

| Verification | `test-plan` | `test-write` |
|---|---|---|
| `tests` | runs | runs |
| `checks` | runs, declares **no** test-writer tickets | **skipped** |
| `none` | **skipped** | **skipped** |

| Review | the four `review.*` nodes |
|---|---|
| `full` | all four run |
| `focused` | the named lenses run; the rest are **skipped** |
| `none` | all four **skipped** |

**A skipped node is kept, with its edges, and marked `skipped`.** `done` and `skipped` both count
as finished (§7), so its successors become ready as soon as their other predecessors finish — no
edge is rewritten, nothing is stitched, and the counts in §1 do not change. That is the whole
reason this is a status and not a deletion. The `maintenance` template already works this way for
`qa-plan`.

Each skip carries a `graph_deviation` row — `drop-node` for a whole step, `reshape` for a narrowed
`review`. The statements, verified against tursodb 0.7.2, are in
`agents/references/strategist-assurance.md`. A skipped step gets **no ticket**; the orchestrator
never has a bounty to bind to a node that will not run.

### What is enforced and what is convention — read this before you trust it

| rule | enforced by |
|---|---|
| `kind ∈ ('work','gate')`, `status` vocabulary | **the database**, via CHECK constraints — cannot be bypassed |
| node id uniqueness, edge uniqueness, one gate row per gate node | **the database**, via PRIMARY KEY |
| the readiness rule, the review gate, the board | **the database**, via views — one definition, not one per reader |
| "no third gate", "no dropped required node", "reason is non-empty", "a skipped test or review step has a deviation" | **you**, by running §8's checks, and G8 after the fact. A trigger can enforce the gate rule if the warehouse schema carries one — check `SELECT name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='trigger'`. Do not assume it does. |
| "the orchestrator owns every status transition" | **nobody.** It is a convention. The schema has no identity concept, so it cannot tell an orchestrator's UPDATE from an agent's. Follow it because the board is incoherent otherwise, not because something will stop you. |

---

## 6. Instantiating the graph

**On `backend: kumiai`** the whole of this section — preflight, the nodes, the edges, the two
gate rows and the `graph-template:` record — is one `instantiate_graph` call plus one
`set_state`, worked through for this template in `../kumiai.md` §4. The node list, the edge
order and the arithmetic below are still the specification it is built from. §7 and §8's reads
are in the same section there, and §8's checks also run as `check_invariants {process:
"new-requirement", requirement: "REQ-NNN"}`.

### Preflight — run this first, on its own

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_node WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-007';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM requirement WHERE id = 'REQ-007';
```

Expect **`0`** then **`1`**. If the first is non-zero the requirement already has a graph;
re-instantiating would either duplicate nodes or orphan the deviations already recorded against
them. Stop and read the existing graph instead.

This is a separate round trip on purpose. **A failing statement does not stop a tursodb script,
and `COMMIT` still commits** (gotcha 9) — so a guard buried inside the same script as the
INSERTs is not a guard.

### The prompts must travel as hex

Gate prompts are free text with a `?` and an em dash, and free text ends a tursodb statement the
moment a `;` terminates a line (gotcha 1). Generate them per requirement:

```bash
printf '%s' "Plan for REQ-007 is ready for review. Approve implementation?" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'
printf '%s' "Findings and bugs from REQ-007 — approve which get repaired." | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'
```

The hex literals in the script below are those two strings for `REQ-007`. **Regenerate them for
your requirement id** — the id is substituted into the prompt, not into a placeholder.

### The script

Replace every `REQ-007` with your requirement id, and the two hex blobs with yours. Verified
against tursodb 0.7.2.

```

**Do not hand-write an `event` row for the instantiation.** Nothing reads one: the guard against
building a second graph is `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_node WHERE requirement_id = …`, which reads
the rows themselves, and no invariant asserts such an event exists. `subject_type` must name a
table (G7 checks it against `sqlite_schema`), and a graph is not a table — it is `graph_node`,
`graph_edge` and `gate` together — so there is no legal value to write it under.

---

## 7. Reading the graph back

**Readiness is a direct-predecessor join, not a traversal.** `WITH RECURSIVE` does not work on
tursodb — verified failing. It is not needed either: readiness propagates one node at a time as
the segment runs, so the transitive closure never has to be computed.

A node is ready when **no direct predecessor is unfinished** — a universal quantifier written as
a `NOT EXISTS`, vacuously true for a root node, which is correct.

```sql
-- what can run right now
SELECT n.id, n.node_key, COALESCE(n.parallel_group, '(serial)') AS batch,
       COALESCE(n.task_id, '(unbound)') AS task
FROM graph_node n
WHERE n.requirement_id = 'REQ-007'
  AND n.status = 'pending'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM graph_edge ge
                   JOIN graph_node gp ON gp.id = ge.from_node
                  WHERE ge.to_node = n.id AND gp.status NOT IN ('done','skipped'))
ORDER BY batch, n.id;
```

`done` **and** `skipped` both count as finished. A node the strategist deliberately skipped must
not hold its successors forever; that is the graph's spelling of a waived task. Note what a waiver
actually is on the ticket side: `v_failed_tasks.waived` is **derived from a `Skipped by user…`
prefix on a work-log line**, not stored in a column, so a stray log line can look like one. The
graph's `skipped` is the sturdier of the two — it is a status a CHECK constrains.

The warehouse schema ships `v_ready_nodes` — **select from it instead of re-typing this
predicate.** Two spellings of readiness is two answers to "what runs next".

```sql
-- the segment: everything ready, grouped into waves, up to the next unresolved gate
SELECT COALESCE(n.parallel_group, '(serial)') AS batch, group_concat(n.id, ' ')
FROM graph_node n
WHERE n.requirement_id = 'REQ-007' AND n.status = 'pending'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM graph_edge ge JOIN graph_node gp ON gp.id = ge.from_node
                  WHERE ge.to_node = n.id AND gp.status NOT IN ('done','skipped'))
GROUP BY 1;

-- the next unresolved gate
SELECT n.id, g.kind, g.status, g.prompt
FROM graph_node n JOIN gate g ON g.node_id = n.id
WHERE n.requirement_id = 'REQ-007' AND g.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY n.id LIMIT 1;
```

---

## 8. Validating a graph you deviated from

Run these after any deviation. Each returns **zero rows when the graph is sound**.

```sql
-- (a) a template key with no instance = a DROPPED node
WITH tpl(k, required) AS (VALUES
  ('gate-plan',1),('implement',1),('test-plan',0),('test-write',0),
  ('review',0),('gate-repairs',1),('repair',0),('document',1))
SELECT 'DROPPED' || CASE WHEN tpl.required = 1 THEN ' (REQUIRED)' ELSE '' END || ': ' || tpl.k

Before an `add-node` deviation, confirm some available subagent declares the capability.
**This one is not SQL** — the roster is the agent files, and nothing in the database can see
them:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py" --covers perf-profiling
```

No output means no member. Do not add the node.

Node counts, as a sanity check against the numbers in §1:

```sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_node WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-007') AS nodes,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_edge WHERE to_node LIKE 'REQ-007/%') AS edges,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM graph_node WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-007' AND kind = 'gate') AS gates;
```

`gates` must be **2**. Not one, not three.
