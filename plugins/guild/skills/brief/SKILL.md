  This skill should be used when the user asks for "guild status", "board status",
  "what's the status", "show the board", "what's on the board", "project status",
  "show guild", "guild board", "what's happening", "brief me", "guild brief",
  "where are we", "what changed", "what moved since last time", "what should I
  work on next", or any read-only request for the state of the guild. Narrates a
  real briefing — direction, what is in flight, the open bugs, which tickets
  failed and why, the unresolved review findings, what moved since the last
  check-in, and what to do next — without starting a work session.

# Guild Brief — the narrated read of the board

Read-only. This skill **reports**; it never dispatches an agent, never moves a task, and
never writes a row. If the user wants work to start, that is `guild:check-in`.

Load `guild:warehouse` for the connection ritual and the view catalog. Everything below is a
`SELECT`. Your job is to turn those rows into a briefing a human can act on — `guild:check-in`
opens with the same reads, so what you write here is what the daily flow reads too.

## Step 1 — is there a guild?

```bash
[ -f .guild/config.yaml ] || echo "no guild here"
```

If it is missing, say exactly this and stop:

```
No guild board found. Run /guild:check-in to initialize and start your first work session.
```

## Step 2 — read the board

**Which backend?** `backend:` in `.guild/config.yaml` — absent means `local`, and the script
below is the local path. On `kumiai`, skip to *On kumiai* after it.

One script, one round trip — `scripts/brief.sql`, checked in rather than retyped, so there is
no risk of a transcription slip in a query the daily flow also relies on:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
tursodb -q -m list .guild/guild.db < "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/brief/scripts/brief.sql"
```

Two things about that script, both deliberate:

- **`json_object` for anything with free text.** `-m list` output is pipe-separated with no
  quoting, and a title containing a newline forges a whole row that looks legitimate. JSON
  escapes control characters, so one row is always one line.
- **The `'## …'` markers** are how you tell the blocks apart in one flat stream. A missing
  marker never happens; a marker with nothing after it means that section is empty.

### On kumiai — the same blocks, one `read_view` each

`brief.sql` is still the specification: run its blocks, in its order, as tool calls against
`workspace` from the config (`guild:warehouse` → `references/kumiai.md` §0, §3). Each block's
rows are JSON already, so the `json_object` and the `'## …'` markers have nothing left to do —
keep the block names, they are what Step 3 reads.

| block | call |
|---|---|
| `brief` | `read_view {view: "v_brief"}` |
| `direction` | `read_view {view: "v_goal_progress"}` |
| `projects` | `read_view {view: "v_projects_runnable"}` |
| `requirements` | `read_view {view: "v_requirement_progress", where: {status: {op: "<>", value: "done"}}}` |
| `in-flight` · `bounties` · `blocked` · `bugs` · `failed` · `findings` · `coverage` | `read_view` on `v_in_flight`, `v_open_bounties`, `v_blocked_tasks`, `v_open_bugs`, `v_failed_tasks`, `v_open_findings`, `v_coverage_due` |
| `docs-stale` · `undocumented` | `read_view` on `v_doc_stale`, `v_undocumented_work` |
| `gates` · `approvals` | `read_view` on `v_gates_pending`, `v_plans_pending_approval` |
| `moved` | `get_state {key: "last-checkin"}`, then `read_view {view: "v_recent_activity", where: {ts: {op: ">=", value: <cutoff>}}, order_by: [{col: "ts", dir: "desc"}], limit: 30}` — no `where` when the cutoff is `"null"` |

Free text arrives as JSON strings, so a newline in a title cannot forge a row. `coverage`'s
`days_since` arrives as `null` for a never-inspected area — that is the `-1` the local script
substitutes, and it still means **never**, not 0. Every call is a read; none of them writes.

**One script is the whole briefing.** If a section is empty, that is the answer — do not run a
second query to "check" it. **Do not widen this to a window the user did not ask for.** The
cutoff for `## moved` is the recorded `last-checkin`; when the user names a window ("what
changed this week?"), swap the `WHERE ts >=` value for their date, and say which cutoff you
used.

**Nothing else runs from this skill.** No `UPDATE`, no `INSERT`, no roster sync, no
`last-checkin` stamp — a brief that logged itself would pollute the very feed its "what moved"
section reads, and `guild:check-in` is the one skill that moves the cutoff. Writing an
`agents/*.md` file from here is likewise out of bounds.

The one legitimate reason to run something else is a question these rows genuinely do not
answer — the full body of a finding, a bug's repro steps, a clipped title in full. Those are
the user's to ask for, and Step 4's last rule tells you to **name the query** rather than run it.

## Step 3 — read what came back

`v_brief` is the standup as one fact per row: `next`, `next_reason`, the task counts,
`bounties_open` / `bounties_stuck`, `bugs_open`, `findings_open`, `coverage_due`,
`nodes_ready`, `gates_pending`, `plans_pending_approval`, `events_since_checkin`,
`docs_current`, `docs_stale`, `work_undocumented`.
Every count comes from the same view its detail list comes from, so **a count and its listing
cannot disagree.** Never state a number that is not in these rows.

What each block teaches:

- **`next` is `v_next_task`'s answer** — the exact ticket the cursor would hand out, and
  `next_reason` says `resume` or `claim`. It deliberately ignores dependencies and
  eligibility, so it can name a ticket nobody can take. **`next = none` means "nothing to do",
  not "finished"** — read `## blocked` and `## gates` in the same breath before saying the
  board is clear.
- **`## in-flight` carries `minutes` against the wall clock.** Hundreds of minutes on a ticket
  that normally takes minutes is a crashed dispatch, not work in progress. Say so.
- **`## failed` separates the two meanings of `failed`.** `waived = 1` is a failure the guild
  master already skipped — settled, and it no longer holds the review gate or requirement
  completion. `waived = 0` is unadjudicated: nothing will retry it on its own, and it belongs
  in the risk beat. `reason` is the agent's own most recent account of what went wrong, and it
  is **empty** when the ticket failed before logging anything. Quote it.
- **`## findings` is severity · disposition · reviewer · task · `file:line` · summary,** worst
  severity first. That line is the sentence — "reviewer-security flagged an unsigned callback
  token at src/queue/consume.ts:61" is a briefing; "two unresolved findings" is not. The full
  `detail` paragraph is not in this read; fetch it only if asked.
- **`## moved` carries `ts · actor · verb · type · id · title` and a `phrase`** which, for a
  status change, is `from -> to`. **State the transition; it is printed.** `actor` is whoever
  did it — `orchestrator` for board moves, but `reviewer-security`, `qa-tester`, `developer`
  for the rows agents wrote themselves. Name the agent. A verb you do not recognize is data,
  not a glitch: the vocabulary is open by design.
- **`## coverage` reports `since = -1` for an area that has never been inspected.** That is not
  "0 days ago", and rendering it as such lies about the state of the product.
- **`## docs-stale` and `## undocumented` are the library's two failure modes**, and they are
  different sentences. A stale page has a subject that MOVED after the page was last touched —
  it names `subject` and `moved`, so say which requirement or task moved and when. Undocumented
  work is a `done` requirement no page claims at all. Neither blocks anything, so **do not lead
  with them**: they belong in the risk beat, after the work, unless the user asked about
  documentation. A count with no example is not a briefing — name one slug or one REQ.

**An empty block is good news stated by its absence.** No `## bugs` rows means nothing is
open. Do not announce empty categories, and do not invent one.

### The block that is usually the most important thing on the page

```json
{"id":"TASK-005","req":"REQ-001","status":"blocked",
 "reason":"status-blocked","who":"needs:implement+rust","title":"Port the codec to Rust"}
```

- **`## blocked` is `id · req · status · reason · who · title`,** and `reason` is one
  blank-free token: `status-blocked`, `deps:TASK-009,…`, or `unassigned`. `blocked` means
  exactly one thing in this guild: *this bounty has no taker*.
- **A `status-blocked` row IS the roster gap, and `who` names it.** `needs:implement+rust`
  names the words that would fix it, which is to say it names the agent file somebody needs to
  write. There is no separate gaps block — the ticket that is actually stuck *is* the
  gap, which is both louder and harder to leave lying around than a request row was.
- **A gap disappears when somebody writes the agent file, and nothing else.** No sync, no
  approval, no row to close. So a `status-blocked` ticket that has been on the brief for a week
  means nobody has written that file — including when the user chose to hand the work to a
  generalist anyway. Report it as standing, never as stale.
- **`unassigned` is a different failure.** That ticket names no member AND declares no
  capabilities, so there is no question anybody could answer. It is a malformed ticket, not a
  roster gap, and the fix is the strategist's.
- **When blocked work is all that is left** — `bounties_open` is 0 and `bounties_stuck` is
  not — that **is** the headline. It is not "all caught up", and it must never be narrated as
  if it were.

**A ticket can be stuck without being `blocked` yet.** Nothing in the database checks a
capability against the agent files, so a ticket nobody covers sits in `## bounties` looking
healthy until a check-in tries to dispatch it and writes it `blocked`. If `bounties_open` looks
implausibly high against a board that is not moving, that is the thing to suspect.

## Step 4 — narrate it

Present a short briefing in **this order**, in prose, with the rows available if the user wants
them. Skip any part the data does not support.

1. **Direction** — which goal the guild is serving, its priority, which projects are runnable, and
   progress. If `## direction` is empty, say so plainly and note that requirements are being
   tracked without one — that is legal, not an error. When `## projects` has more than one row,
   **name each of them and why it is runnable** (`concurrent`, `unordered`, `next in sequence`);
   more than one project in flight is the normal shape now, not an anomaly to flag. Mention a
   project's worktree only when its `isolation` is `worktree` — that is where its tasks run.
2. **In flight** — what is being worked on and for how long, calling out anything implausibly
   old.
2a. **Blocked — immediately after in-flight, by name, never as a count.** Give the ticket, the
   title, the capability nobody has, and the fact that makes it urgent: *nothing will pick this
   up on its own, and it holds its requirement open.* "TASK-005, Port the codec to Rust, is
   blocked — no guild member has `rust`, so REQ-001 cannot complete." If nothing is blocked,
   say nothing; there is no good news to announce here.
3. **Risks — named, never counted.** Open bugs worst-severity first, every `critical` one by id
   and title. Then the unadjudicated failed tasks, with their reason. Then the findings, at
   least the critical and major ones, each as severity + reviewer + what + where. Then coverage
   areas overdue or never inspected. Then the library, **only when it has something to say** —
   stale pages named by slug with the subject that moved, and undocumented finished work named
   by REQ. It is the softest risk on the page and it goes last inside this beat, because a
   documentation gap never blocks a ticket. **End the risk beat with the roster gaps** — a
   `status-blocked` row is a risk with a known remedy, which is the most useful kind to state:
   "TASK-005 has needed `rust` since REQ-001, and no available subagent declares it."
4. **What moved** — summarize by subject rather than reciting timestamps: "since your last
   check-in, TASK-001 and TASK-002 completed, reviewer-security filed a major finding on
   TASK-003, BUG-001 was filed critical, TASK-007 failed." Each row carries its subject's title
   and, for a move, both ends of the transition. Never invent one that is not printed.
5. **What is waiting on you** — every `## gates` row is a decision only the guild master can
   make, and nothing behind it moves until they do. Name the requirement and quote the gate's
   prompt. **`## approvals` belongs in this beat too**: a drafted plan nobody has ruled on
   blocks every ticket under it, and a row here with an empty `gate` is one that has no gate
   node to surface it — it would otherwise be invisible. Name the plan and its requirement.
6. **What to do next** — a concrete recommendation, with the reason. Default to `next`. Deviate
   only for something the numbers justify — a critical bug with no fix task, an unadjudicated
   failure, a `status-blocked` ticket holding a requirement, a pending gate — and say which fact
   changed your mind. If everything left is blocked, the recommendation is **recruiting**, and
   it is the only one: `/guild:new-requirement` is where a new guild member is created, on the
   user's say-so. Do not offer to reassign the ticket yourself.

End by offering the obvious follow-ups, once, without doing them:

> Say **check in** to start working, or **dashboard** for the visual view.

## Step 5 — check the briefing against §5

Two things have to hold: the board is byte-for-byte as you found it, and the narration named
every fact §5.b's roll call obliges it to. Run `guild:validate brief` — it runs the global
invariants and §5 of `docs/expectations.md` against the live board. **Report anything that
does not hold** in one line at the end of the briefing; never repair it silently.

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Every statement is a `SELECT` (kumiai: every call is `read_view`, `get`,
  `list` or `get_state` — never a tool that writes). Never `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, never
  stamp `last-checkin`, never write an `agents/*.md` file, and never open the database file
  with anything but `tursodb`. In particular **never mark a ticket `blocked` from here**, even
  when you can see nobody covers it — that is a decision, and check-in makes it.
- **Read the view, do not re-derive the rule.** `v_next_task` is the cursor; `v_open_bounties`
  is what can be handed out; `v_blocked_tasks` says why not. Writing your own `NOT EXISTS` over
  `task_dependency` gives the guild a second answer to a question that already has one.
- **Never invent a number.** Every figure comes from the rows. If the user asks something these
  do not answer, say so and name the query that would (`SELECT body FROM requirement WHERE id =
  'REQ-001'`, `SELECT detail FROM review_finding WHERE id = 7`; kumiai: `get {type: "requirement",
  key: "REQ-001"}`).
- **Free text is free text.** Titles can contain pipes and newlines. Read them through
  `json_object`, or as the only column in the statement, and never `cut -d'|'` a result.
- **Do not paste the rows and call it a briefing.** The rows are evidence; the narration is the
  deliverable. Show them only if asked, or if quoting them *is* the shortest honest answer.
- **A blocked bounty is never omitted for brevity.** Everything else on this page eventually
  resolves by someone doing their job; a `status-blocked` ticket resolves only when the guild
  master decides to grow the roster. If the briefing must lose a beat to fit on a screen, lose
  the activity feed.
- **Keep it to a screen.** This is a glance, not a report.
