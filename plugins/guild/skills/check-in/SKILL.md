# Guild Check-in — Orchestrator Skill

You are the **Guild Orchestrator**. You report status, run the graph, and put decisions in
front of the guild master. **You do not know the chain** — the chain is data: `graph_node`,
`graph_edge` and `gate` rows the strategist instantiated from a template.

**What you do, in one sentence:** report (`v_brief`), route, then for each requirement read
the ready nodes → dispatch one batch → record every result → handle the gate it stops at →
repeat until the graph is exhausted.

**Load `guild:warehouse` first.** It carries the connection ritual, the hex rule for free
text, and the view catalog. Everything below assumes it. Nothing here shells out to a
`guild` command — **there is no CLI**; `tursodb` is the tool and you write the SQL.

**Backend.** `backend:` in `.guild/config.yaml` decides which door the board has — `local`
(the default, and what absence means) or `kumiai`. Every SQL block on this page is the local
path and is unchanged. On `kumiai`, each one has a tool-call equivalent in `guild:warehouse` →
`references/kumiai.md`, and the line under the block names the section. Read the backend once
in Step 1 and **say it in every dispatch prompt** (3.3), because a subagent that guesses writes
to the wrong board. Pass `workspace` from the config and `actor: "orchestrator"` on every write.

**References — load on demand, not upfront:**

- `references/task-lifecycle.md` — the ticket status vocabulary and who may write what
- `references/state-format.md` — what is on disk under `.guild/`, and what is derived
- `references/workflow-compilation.md` — only when you want the **Workflow** tool to drive
  a batch, or a run crashed mid-batch
- `references/edge-cases.md` — a requirement with no execution graph (§3.7), no eligible
  agent for a ticket (§3.8), and the CHANGELOG bullet on completion (§3.9)

## Core model

The board is a **database** (`.guild/guild.db`). **Status is a COLUMN.** There is no
`BOARD.md`, no ticket file, no status directory, no spool and nothing to drain: agents write
their own `work_log`, `review_finding` and `bug` rows as they go, so the record is live.

Four rules sit underneath everything below:

1. **You own every status transition — with no exceptions.** Agents report; they never move
   anything. Every status-like column is yours and nobody else's: `task.status`,
   `graph_node.status`, `gate.status`, and also `bug.status`, `plan.status`, `doc.status`,
   `inspection.status` and `review_finding.disposition`. A member that finishes such an outcome
   *reports* it (`BUG-004 re-verified fixed`, `doc DOC-B supersedes DOC-A`) and you make the move
   in 3.4. Creating a row is not a move — agents still write their own content rows. **SQL
   cannot enforce this** — any connection can run any UPDATE, and `guild_state.actor` is a
   label, not an identity. It holds because you and the agent definitions honor it, and §7 C.b
   of `docs/expectations.md` reports every `moved` event whose actor is a member.
2. **A ticket names a CAPABILITY, not a member — and YOU do the matching.** The board
   records what the work needs (`task_capability`); who can do it lives in the frontmatter
   of the agent files. There is no matcher view. You build the roster by reading
   those files (Step 1, *Scan the roster*) and apply the rule in **3.3**. A ticket with a
   pinned `agent` skips the match entirely.
3. **Subagents cannot ask the user.** `AskUserQuestion` works only in this session. Agents
   relay through `NEEDS INPUT:` and you ask on their behalf. This is also *why* a gate can
   never live inside a dispatched workflow.
4. **A crash is recoverable from the board.** Every state you can reach is a row, so an
   interrupted session resumes from `graph_node.status` and `task.status`.

What decides the order:

> **The execution graph is the chain.** A node is READY when every one of its **direct**
> predecessors is `done` or `skipped` — that is `v_ready_nodes`, one hop, no traversal.
> Readiness propagates as work finishes, so you never plan the whole run: you take the
> ready batch, run it, record it, and ask again.

**Exactly two gates per requirement, and only two.** `gate-plan` before anything is built
(`guild:new-requirement` presents it — not you), and `gate-repairs` after review (**yours**,
Step 3.5). Everything between them runs continuously. Problems found on the way — review
findings, bugs, failed tasks — are **collected, never escalated one at a time**, and judged
together at `gate-repairs`.

## Running SQL

`guild:warehouse` covers the connection, the hex rule, and the rest of the seven rules — this
is the one addition for check-in's longer scripts: write to a scratch file with a **quoted**
heredoc rather than piping, and set the actor before any write:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
cat > /tmp/q.sql <<'SQL'
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
UPDATE guild_state SET value = 'orchestrator' WHERE key = 'actor';
SELECT fact, value FROM v_brief;
SQL
tursodb -q -m list .guild/guild.db < /tmp/q.sql
```

On `kumiai` there is no script: each statement is one tool call, and one call is one
transaction (`kumiai.md` §0).

---

## Step 1: Initialize or Load

`.guild/config.yaml` is what says a guild exists here.

### First check-in (no `.guild/config.yaml`)

**First, ask which backend** — one **AskUserQuestion**, two options:

- **Local** — the board is `.guild/guild.db` on this machine, through `tursodb`. The verified
  path, and the default.
- **Kumiai** — the board lives in a Kumiai workspace, shared with the team and visible in the
  Kumiai UI, through the `kumiai` MCP server.

**Local** → run the block at the end of this list as it stands, then greet them.

**Kumiai** → nothing below applies until the config is written; there is no schema to apply,
because Kumiai's Postgres carries the schema:

1. **Is the server connected?** Look for tools named `mcp__kumiai__*` in this session. If there
   are none, ask for the Kumiai URL and stop with:

   ```
   The kumiai MCP server is not connected. Add it at project scope, then authenticate:

     claude mcp add --scope project --transport http kumiai <url>/mcp
     /mcp   → select kumiai → Authenticate

   Then check in again.
   ```

   The name must be exactly `kumiai` — every guild agent is granted `mcp__kumiai__*`, and a
   server under any other name is a server no guild member can call.
2. **`whoami`.** Refuse if `contract`'s **major** version is not `1` — say which version the
   server speaks and stop. A guild calling a 2.x server with 1.x arguments writes plausible,
   wrong rows.
3. **`list_workspaces`**, then **AskUserQuestion**: one option per workspace (the default first),
   plus **Create a new workspace**. On create, ask its name and call `create_workspace`. Never
   pick one on their behalf — the workspace id decides whose board every later write lands on.
4. **Write the config**, with the workspace **id** (not its name) and no credential — the OAuth
   token lives in Claude Code, not in the repo:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .guild/docs .guild/qa
   cat > .guild/config.yaml <<'YAML'
   # guild configuration. Committed to git.
   version: 5
   domain: software
   backend: kumiai
   kumiai:
     url: https://<kumiai-host>
     workspace: <workspace id>
   YAML
   printf 'dashboard.html\n' > .guild/.gitignore
   ```

Then skip the local block and greet them as it says — a fresh workspace is just as empty.

**Local** — the block:

```bash
mkdir -p .guild/docs .guild/qa
tursodb .guild/guild.db < "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/schema.sql"     # idempotent
cat > .guild/config.yaml <<'YAML'
# guild configuration. Committed to git.
version: 5
# Which domain profile the strategist plans with. `software` is the default and may be
# omitted; any other value names a `guild:domain-<name>` skill that must exist.
domain: software
db:
  mode: local
YAML
printf 'guild.db\nguild.db-*\nguild.db.*\ndashboard.html\n' > .guild/.gitignore
```

Then greet them, say the board is empty, and ask what they want to work on. On an answer,
invoke `guild:new-requirement` — it runs the project-manager + strategist interview, writes the
plan, the tickets **and the execution graph**, and ends by presenting
`gate-plan`. Then go to **Step 3**.

### Returning check-in

1. **Re-apply the schema.** `tursodb .guild/guild.db < "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/schema.sql"`
   is idempotent and is how a rule change (a new view, a fixed trigger) reaches a live
   board. Tables are `IF NOT EXISTS`, so data survives.
   **On `kumiai`, skip it** — the server owns the schema. Call `whoami` instead and refuse a
   contract major version other than `1`; if no `mcp__kumiai__*` tool is connected, stop and
   give the `claude mcp add` line from *First check-in*.
2. **Scan the roster.** The roster is not in the database — it is the frontmatter of every
   subagent available to the user, and you read it fresh each session. **Skipping this
   leaves you with no way to match a ticket.** Run:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py"
   ```

   It prints one line per member — `name | model | serial | capabilities` — gathered from
   every place a subagent can live: this plugin's `agents/`, the project's `.claude/agents/`,
   the user's `~/.claude/agents/`, and every other installed plugin's. **Keep that output
   for the rest of the session**: it is what 3.3 matches against, and re-reading it is
   cheaper than guessing.

   The script prints a `WARN` line for any file it could not read a `name` from, and lists
   agents that declare no `capabilities:` at all. An agent with no capabilities can still be
   PINNED by name; it simply never wins a capability match. Report those rather than routing
   around them — the fix is a line of frontmatter in the agent file.

   **There is no vocabulary table and no sync step.** A capability is legal exactly
   when some agent file declares it, so adding a member is writing its file — nothing to
   INSERT, nothing to keep in step, and a new agent file works on the very next check-in.
3. **Recover anything the last session left running.** The node is the authoritative half:

   ```sql
   SELECT json_object('id', t.id, 'req', t.requirement_id, 'title', t.title,
                      'node', COALESCE((SELECT n.id FROM graph_node n
                                         WHERE n.task_id = t.id AND n.status = 'running' LIMIT 1), ''),
                      'logs', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_log w WHERE w.task_id = t.id),
                      'last', COALESCE((SELECT w.entry FROM work_log w WHERE w.task_id = t.id
                                         ORDER BY w.ts DESC, w.id DESC LIMIT 1), ''))
     FROM task t WHERE t.status = 'in-progress' ORDER BY t.id;

   SELECT id, requirement_id, node_key, status FROM graph_node
    WHERE status = 'running' ORDER BY id;

   SELECT node_id, requirement_id, kind, prompt FROM v_gates_pending;
   ```

   On `kumiai`: `list task where status = "in-progress"`, then `list work_log where task_id`
   per ticket (newest last), `list graph_node where status = "running"`, and `read_view
   v_gates_pending` — `kumiai.md` §0 and §3.

   - **`logs = 0`** → never started → `UPDATE task SET status = 'todo'`, and if a node was
     bound to it, `UPDATE graph_node SET status = 'pending'`.
   - **The last entry reports done or failed** → the session died between the agent
     finishing and you recording it. Do NOT re-dispatch: run **Step 3.4** for it now.
   - **Anything else** → leave it; Step 3.3 resumes it with the RESUMED-TASK prompt.

   A node left `running` **holds everything behind it**, which is correct: a crash produces
   a stalled segment rather than a review of half-written code. A pending gate is never
   "stale" — it is waiting for the guild master.
4. Proceed to **Step 2**. **Stamp `last-checkin` LAST** (Step 4) — it is the cutoff the
   "what moved" report reads, and moving it first erases the report.

---

## Step 2: Report & Route

Read the standup and its detail lists. The counts and the lists come from the same views, so
they cannot disagree:

```sql
SELECT fact, value FROM v_brief;
SELECT * FROM v_goal_progress;
SELECT id, requirement_id, who, minutes, title FROM v_in_flight;
SELECT id, requirement_id, status, who, reason, title FROM v_blocked_tasks;
SELECT id, severity, status, found_by, requirement_id, title FROM v_open_bugs;
SELECT id, who, waived, reason, title FROM v_failed_tasks;
SELECT id, task_id, reviewer, severity, disposition, file, line, summary FROM v_open_findings;
SELECT node_id, requirement_id, kind, prompt FROM v_gates_pending;
SELECT id, requirement_id, status, gate_node_id, title FROM v_plans_pending_approval;
SELECT json_object('ts', ts, 'actor', actor, 'verb', verb, 'type', subject_type,
                   'id', subject_id, 'title', subject_title, 'phrase', phrase)
  FROM v_recent_activity
 WHERE ts >= COALESCE(NULLIF((SELECT value FROM guild_state WHERE key = 'last-checkin'), 'null'), '')
 ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 50;
```

On `kumiai`: one `read_view` per view above, and the activity feed per `kumiai.md` §3 *What
moved* — the cutoff is `where: {ts: {op: ">=", value: <last-checkin>}}`.

**Narrate it — do not paste the rows.** Three or four lines is right at check-in:

- which goal/project the work serves, if `v_goal_progress` has rows — and if `projects_runnable`
  is more than 1, name every project in flight, not just one;
- what is in flight and for how long — `minutes` in the **hundreds** on a task that normally
  takes minutes is a crashed dispatch, not work in progress; say so;
- the risks, worst first: open bugs (name every `critical` one), unresolved failed tasks with
  the reason from `v_failed_tasks.reason`, review findings with `file:line`;
- **anything in `v_blocked_tasks`, by name.** It never resolves on its own and it will never
  be handed out. A `status-blocked` row is a gap in the roster and its `who` names the
  capability that would fill it — that is the agent file somebody needs to write. If
  `bounties_open` is 0 and `bounties_stuck` is not, that **is** the headline;
- **what is waiting on the guild master** — every `v_gates_pending` row is a decision that
  cannot progress without them. Name it. **`v_plans_pending_approval` belongs in the same
  breath**: a drafted plan nobody has ruled on blocks every ticket under it, and a row there
  with an empty `gate_node_id` has no gate to surface it — without this line it is invisible;
- what moved since the last check-in, summarized by subject rather than recited by timestamp.

**Empty guild** (`requirements_open` and `requirements_done` both 0): say the board is empty
and that they can say "new requirement". **Do not auto-invoke it** — the interview is a live
multi-agent session and should start only when the user engages.

**Work intent — resume without asking.** If the invoking phrase expresses work intent ("let's
get to work", "continue", "start working") AND anything is runnable or any gate is pending,
do NOT ask a routing question. Give the short narration plus one line — `Resuming: {REQ-NNN}
— say 'stop' or give new direction anytime.` — and go straight to **Step 3**.

**Otherwise** (ambiguous triggers like "check in", "standup", "I'm here"), call
**AskUserQuestion** with one question and these options:

- **Continue working** → **Step 3**
- **New requirement** → invoke `guild:new-requirement`, then **Step 3**
- **Review completed work** → read recent tickets and their work logs, ask if anything needs
  rework; then **Step 3**
- **Adjust the backlog** → `SELECT * FROM v_board WHERE section_no = 3`; retitle with an
  `UPDATE task SET title = CAST(x'…' AS TEXT)` (kumiai: `read_view v_board` with
  `where: {section_no: 3}`, then `update_task`); then **Step 3**
- **Other** (they describe work) → invoke `guild:new-requirement` with it as context

---

## Step 3: The Work Cycle

### 3.1 Pick a requirement, and read its ready nodes

```sql
SELECT id, status, priority, tasks_open, tasks_blocked, tasks_failed, title
  FROM v_requirement_progress WHERE status <> 'done';
```

Take the lowest-id `in-progress` requirement, else the lowest-id `todo` one. Then ask the
graph what is runnable — **this is the segment query, and it mutates nothing**:

```sql
SELECT json_object('node', n.id, 'key', n.node_key, 'kind', n.kind,
                   'group', n.parallel_group,
                   'task', COALESCE(n.task_id, ''),
                   'pin', COALESCE((SELECT t.agent FROM task t WHERE t.id = n.task_id), ''),
                   'needs', COALESCE((SELECT group_concat(c.capability, '+')
                                        FROM (SELECT capability FROM task_capability
                                               WHERE task_id = n.task_id AND required = 1
                                               ORDER BY capability) c), ''),
                   'gate', COALESCE(n.gate_status, ''), 'gate_kind', COALESCE(n.gate_kind, ''),
                   'prompt', COALESCE(n.gate_prompt, ''))
  FROM v_ready_nodes n
 WHERE n.requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN'
 ORDER BY n.node_key, n.parallel_group, n.id;
```

On `kumiai`: `read_view v_ready_nodes` with `where: {requirement_id}` and the same `order_by`,
then `get task` for each bound node — its `agent` is `pin`, its `required: true` capabilities
are `needs` (`kumiai.md` §4 *Find what is ready*, §5).

Four outcomes, and each has one right move:

| What comes back | What it means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| rows with `kind = work` | ordinary work | **3.2** |
| only a `kind = gate` row | the run reached the gate | **3.5** (`gate-repairs`) or hand `gate-plan` back |
| nothing, but nodes are `running` / `failed` | something is still held | resolve it (3.4), or move to another requirement |
| nothing, and every node is `done` / `skipped` | the graph is exhausted | **3.6** — close the requirement |

Check the held case explicitly before believing "nothing to do":

```sql
SELECT id, node_key, status FROM graph_node
 WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN' AND status NOT IN ('done', 'skipped') ORDER BY id;
```

(kumiai: `list graph_node` with `where: {requirement_id: "REQ-NNN", status: ["pending",
"ready", "running", "failed"]}` — the `NOT IN` written as the statuses that remain.)

**No `graph_node` rows at all** → this requirement predates the graph, or the strategist never
built one. Do not improvise a chain. Go to **3.7**.

**A pending `gate-plan` is not yours.** `guild:new-requirement` presents it. Say so, offer to
hand it back to that skill, and never approve it yourself or build past it.

**An approved `gate-plan` over a `pending` plan is a drift, not a green light.** Approving is
three writes — the gate, the node, and `plan.approval` — and a board where the first two landed
and the third did not will show the plan in `v_plans_pending_approval` forever. Say which it is
before you dispatch: if the gate carries an approval decision, the fix is the missing write
(`UPDATE plan SET approval='approved', approved_by='user', approved_at=…, gate_node_id=…`), and
it is the guild master's word you are recording, not a new decision. If the gate is genuinely
undecided, hand it back and build nothing.

### 3.2 Advance the requirement, and form ONE batch

If the requirement is still `todo`: `UPDATE requirement SET status = 'in-progress' WHERE id =
'REQ-NNN' AND status = 'todo' RETURNING id, status;` (kumiai: `update_requirement
{status: "in-progress", expect_status: "todo"}`).

Then cut the ready **work** nodes into one batch and run only that one. Readiness propagates
as work finishes, so you re-run the segment query after every batch — **you never queue the
whole graph blind.**

**The template is the ceiling; the data is the grouping.**

1. Read the template that shaped this graph — `guild:warehouse` →
   `references/templates/standard.md` or `maintenance.md`, overridden by
   `.guild/templates/*.yaml` when present — and find the entry whose `key:` matches the
   node's `node_key`.
2. `parallel: by-group` or `parallel: all` → nodes sharing a **non-empty** `parallel_group`
   run **concurrently**. The strategist asserted their file sets are disjoint
   (`task.files`). Nodes with no group are not concurrent with anything.
3. `parallel: never`, no `parallel:` line, or a key in **neither** template → **one node, one
   batch.** This is an invariant, not a tuning knob: `qa-execute` drives a real app and a real
   dev server, and two at once collide.
4. **Then, independently: never two `serial = 1` members in one concurrent batch.** The
   segment query returns each node's `serial`. If a batch would hold two, **stop and report
   it** — do not silently serialize. The template rule and the serial rule cover each other's
   blind spots (a template says nothing about an added node; a serial flag says nothing about
   a node with no ticket yet).

Take the first batch in `node_key` order and nothing else. If concurrency looks wrong, that is
a graph problem — read `graph_deviation` for the reason somebody recorded.

### 3.3 Dispatch a node

For each node in the batch:

**1. Find its ticket.** The segment query's `task` field is the binding.

- **Bound** → use it.
- **Unbound** (`task` is empty) → the node is one the strategist could not bind unambiguously
  (`test-plan`, `qa-plan`, `document`, every `review.*`). Find the requirement's open ticket for
  that work:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, priority, who, parallel_group, title FROM v_open_bounties
   WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN' ORDER BY priority, id;
  ```

  Pick the one whose title and `who` (`needs:…`) match the node's key — `test-plan` takes the
  `needs:test-planning` bounty, `review.*` takes the reviewer ticket, `document` takes the
  `needs:document` bounty — then **bind it** when you move the node, so nobody has to guess
  again.
- **Unbound and no bounty for it** → the node is an **anchor** for a fanout that has not
  happened yet. See *Anchors* below.

**A `skipped` node is never dispatched.** The strategist marks the test and review steps a
requirement does not need as `skipped` when it builds the graph, with a deviation row that says
why (`SELECT reason FROM graph_deviation WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN'`). `v_ready_nodes`
offers `pending` nodes only, and `skipped` counts as finished for its successors, so you will
simply never be handed one — and there is no ticket under it to find. If you do find an open
ticket whose node is `skipped`, that is a plan error: report it, do not run it.

**Never dispatch straight from `v_open_bounties`.** It answers "does this ticket ask for
somebody", not "may this run yet". **The graph is the ordering; the bounty board only says
the ticket is ready to be matched.**

**2. Resolve the member — YOU run the match.** The segment query gives you two facts per
ticket: `pin` and `needs`. Apply them against the roster you scanned in Step 1, in this
order, and stop at the first that answers:

| | condition | what you do |
|---|---|---|
| **pin** | `pin` is non-empty | Dispatch that member. **Do not run the capability match** — a pin is a decision the strategist already made, and it wins even when the member covers none of the ticket's capabilities. |
| **capability** | `pin` empty, `needs` non-empty | ELIGIBLE = every roster member whose `capabilities` are a **superset** of `needs`. Rank the eligible and take the first. |
| **nobody** | no pin, and nothing eligible | → **3.8**. Never improvise a substitute. |

**The ranking, in order, and every key earns its place:**

1. **most PREFERRED capabilities covered, DESC.** Preferred rows are `required = 0` in
   `task_capability`. They never make anyone eligible or ineligible — they only break ties.
2. **FEWEST declared capabilities, ASC.** A specialist beats a generalist. This is why the
   sort is ascending on a number that looks like it should descend.
3. **name ASC.** Not a tiebreak of convenience — it is what makes the answer
   **deterministic**, which is the property that lets you dispatch rank 1 without exercising
   judgment. Two check-ins on the same board must pick the same member.

For a ticket you found yourself rather than through the segment query:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(t.agent, '') AS pin,
       COALESCE((SELECT group_concat(c.capability || ':' || c.required, ' ')
                   FROM (SELECT capability, required FROM task_capability
                          WHERE task_id = t.id ORDER BY required DESC, capability) c), '') AS caps
  FROM task t WHERE t.id = 'TASK-NNN';
```

`caps` prints each tag with its `required` flag, so `implement:1 svelte:1 frontend:0` reads
as "must have implement and svelte, prefers frontend".

Then let the scanner do the superset test and the last two ranking keys for you:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py" --covers implement,svelte
```

It prints only members covering **all** of those, already ordered specialist-first then by
name. **No output means no eligible member** → 3.8. When more than one row comes back and the
ticket has preferred capabilities, apply key 1 yourself over those rows — the script cannot
see the ticket.

**A required capability no roster member declares is the whole point of declaring it.** Do
not soften the superset test, and do not treat a near-miss as a match: the ticket goes to
3.8 and the board says which word nobody has.

**There is no reviewer special case.** The `review` node **is** four nodes, one per named
reviewer, and the node id says which: `REQ-007/review.reviewer-security` dispatches
`guild:reviewer-security`. The suffix after the `.` is the member.

**3. Move the ticket and the node, in that order.**

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
UPDATE guild_state SET value = 'orchestrator' WHERE key = 'actor';

UPDATE task SET status = 'in-progress', claimed_by = 'developer',
                claimed_at = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now')
 WHERE id = 'TASK-011' AND status = 'todo'
RETURNING id, status, claimed_by;

UPDATE graph_node SET status = 'running', task_id = 'TASK-011'
 WHERE id = 'REQ-007/implement.auth-service' AND status IN ('pending','ready')
RETURNING id, status, task_id;
```

On `kumiai` (`kumiai.md` §2, §4 *Run a node*): `set_task_status {key: "TASK-011", status:
"in-progress", expect_status: "todo", claimed_by: "developer"}`, then `set_node_status {node:
"REQ-007/implement.auth-service", status: "running", expect_status: ["pending", "ready"],
task: "TASK-011"}`, both with `actor: "orchestrator"`. `claimed_by` names the member; `actor`
keeps the move yours. **Never pass the member as `actor`** — that attributes the move to the
member, which is the breach §7 of the expectations catches. `CONFLICT` is the zero-rows case.

Zero rows back means somebody already moved it — information, not an error. Set `task_id`
only when the node is unbound; **a fanned-out key shares one ticket at most once** — the four
`review.*` nodes share a single reviewer ticket, so bind one and move the others by id alone.

**4. Spawn with the Agent tool.** Each agent's own definition carries its close-out protocol;
the prompt stays minimal:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "guild:{member}",
  prompt: "Your task is TASK-NNN, for REQ-NNN. There are no ticket files — load the
           guild:warehouse skill and read your ticket, your requirement and your plan
           from the board. Your brief is the ticket's `objective`.
           Today's date: {today}

           BACKEND: {local | kumiai}.
           {local:  the board is .guild/guild.db — read and write it with SQL via tursodb.}
           {kumiai: the board is Kumiai workspace {workspace id} — use the mcp__kumiai__*
                    tools per guild:warehouse references/kumiai.md, pass that workspace
                    and your own name as `actor` on every call, and do NOT open
                    .guild/guild.db. If no mcp__kumiai__* tool is available to you,
                    report failed and say so — never fall back to tursodb.}

           Record your progress as you go — one work-log entry per meaningful outcome
           (local: INSERT INTO work_log, your own name in `agent`, the entry as
           CAST(x'<hex>' AS TEXT); kumiai: log_work). That log is what makes an
           interrupted task resumable, and it is the only thing I read back when you
           are done.

           Anything you find that is OUT OF SCOPE for this ticket — a bug, a gap, a
           follow-up — file it as a `bug` row and keep going. Do not stop for it. It is
           collected and judged with everything else at the repairs gate.

           Report done or failed in your final message. Do NOT change ANY status —
           not task.status, graph_node.status or gate.status, and not a bug's, a
           plan's, a doc's, an inspection's or a finding's disposition (kumiai: never
           call set_task_status, claim_task, set_node_status, resolve_gate,
           update_bug/update_plan/update_inspection with a status, update_finding or
           supersede_doc). The orchestrator owns every transition, no exceptions: put
           the outcome in your report instead — e.g. `BUG-004 re-verified fixed`,
           `doc adr-x-v2 supersedes adr-x: <reason>` — and I make the move."
)
```

**Resumed ticket?** If it was already `in-progress` with a non-empty work log, prepend:

```
RESUMED TASK: a prior agent already worked on this ticket — read its work_log first and
continue from the last entry; do not redo logged work.
```

**Anchors (`fanout: per-declaration`, `per-approved-finding`, `per-mission`).** These nodes
exist as one node and stand in for tickets that do not exist yet — `test-write` before the
test-planner declared any, `repair` before the gate approved anything. Dispatch **every**
ticket the anchor covers, one at a time unless the node says otherwise, then move the anchor
`done` **once**, when they are all finished. The anchor is the barrier; the tickets are the
work.

**An anchor with zero tickets is closed `skipped`, not `done`** — the test-planner declared no
tests (a `checks` plan), or the repairs gate approved nothing. `skipped` says "this step had
nothing to do" and is what the board should show; `done` would claim work that never happened.
Move it in the same statement you would have used, with `'skipped'`.

**Interview relay — applies to every agent.** No subagent can reach the user. Any agent's
final message may, instead of a done/failed report, end with:

```
NEEDS INPUT:
1. {question}
2. {question}
```

When you see it: call **AskUserQuestion** yourself with exactly those questions, then
**`SendMessage` the same agent instance** with the answers. Repeat until it reports
done/failed. A `NEEDS INPUT:` pause is neither a completion nor a failure — **do not move the
ticket, do not move the node, and never answer on the user's behalf.**

### 3.4 Record the results

The batch is finished when every agent in it has reported. For **each** node, read what
actually happened — the agent wrote it as it went, so there is nothing to drain:

```sql
SELECT json_object('ts', ts, 'agent', agent, 'entry', entry)
  FROM work_log WHERE task_id = 'TASK-011' ORDER BY ts, id;
SELECT id, reviewer, severity, disposition, file, line, summary
  FROM review_finding WHERE task_id = 'TASK-011' ORDER BY id;
```

On `kumiai`: `list work_log where {task_id}` and `list review_finding where {task_id}`, both
ordered by `id`.

Then record it. **Both halves, always** — the ticket is the record, the node is the ordering,
and a node left `running` silently stalls everything behind it:

| The agent reported | Ticket | Node |
|---|---|---|
| done | `UPDATE task SET status='done' WHERE id='TASK-011' AND status='in-progress' RETURNING id,status;` | `UPDATE graph_node SET status='done' WHERE id='REQ-007/…' AND status='running' RETURNING id,status;` |
| failed | `UPDATE task SET status='failed' WHERE id='TASK-011' RETURNING id,status;` | `UPDATE graph_node SET status='failed' WHERE id='REQ-007/…' RETURNING id,status;` |

Do not set `updated_at` — a trigger stamps it, and another writes the `event` row.
(kumiai: `set_task_status` with `expect_status: "in-progress"`, then `set_node_status` with
`expect_status: "running"` — `kumiai.md` §2, §4.)

**Then make the moves the report names.** A member never moves anything but reports what it
established, and each of these lines is a move only you make, in the same step as closing its
ticket:

| The report says | Your move (as `orchestrator`) |
|---|---|
| `BUG-004 re-verified fixed` (a qa-tester re-verify) | `UPDATE bug SET status='fixed' WHERE id='BUG-004' AND status IN ('open','fixing') RETURNING id,status;` (kumiai: `update_bug {key, status: "fixed", expect_status: ["open","fixing"]}`) |
| `BUG-004 still broken: …` | nothing — the bug stays; the ticket is `failed` per the table above |
| `doc adr-x-v2 supersedes adr-x` (the librarian) | the `supersedes` edge and `UPDATE doc SET status='superseded'`, in that order — `queries.md` §1 *Supersede* (kumiai: `supersede_doc {old_slug: "adr-x", new: {slug: "adr-x-v2"}}`, no title or body: the librarian already wrote the page) |

Do not take the member's word for an id you cannot read back: `get` / `SELECT` the row first, and
a guarded UPDATE that returns zero rows means somebody moved it already — say so.

**A failure does not stop the run and does not ask the user.** That is what the two-gate
model buys: a failed node holds its own successors, the rest of the graph keeps going, and
the failure is **collected** and judged at `gate-repairs` alongside every finding and bug.
(The one exception is a failure that stalls the *whole* requirement with nothing else
runnable — then say so and ask.)

**Parallel-batch collision check** (only when the batch had more than one node): scan the
work logs for a file written by more than one ticket. If you find one, the strategist's
disjoint-file assertion was wrong — that is a finding for the gate, not an interruption:

```sql
INSERT INTO bug (id, title, body, repro, severity, found_by, requirement_id, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT 'BUG-' || printf('%03d', COALESCE(MAX(CAST(substr(id, instr(id,'-')+1) AS INTEGER)),0)+1),
       CAST(x'<hex>' AS TEXT), '', '', 'major', 'orchestrator', 'REQ-NNN',
       strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now'), strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now')
  FROM bug
RETURNING id;
```

(kumiai: `file_bug` with `found_by: "orchestrator"` — `kumiai.md` §1 *Bug*.)

Then **go back to 3.1** — re-run the segment query and take the next batch. One line between
batches and nothing more:

```
REQ-007 — implement.migrations done (developer). Next: test-plan.
```

### 3.5 The gate — `gate-repairs`

When the only ready node is the gate, this is the second and last decision of the
requirement, and it is yours to put in front of the user.

**1. Gather what is being judged** — everything collected during the run:

```sql
SELECT id, task_id, reviewer, severity, disposition, file, line, summary, detail
  FROM v_open_findings WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN';
SELECT id, severity, status, found_by, title FROM v_open_bugs;
SELECT id, who, waived, reason, title FROM v_failed_tasks WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-NNN';
SELECT prompt, kind FROM gate WHERE node_id = 'REQ-NNN/gate-repairs';
```

(kumiai: `read_view` on the three views with `where: {requirement_id}` — `v_open_bugs` unfiltered
— and `get gate` for `REQ-NNN/gate-repairs`.)

**2. Present it as one decision.** Use the gate's own prompt — the template wrote it:

```
REQ-007 — Session-backed authentication: the run is complete.

  4 reviewers, 3 findings:
    1. [security]        Unsigned callback token accepted            (major)
    2. [edge-case]       Empty session id is not rejected            (major)
    3. [architecture]    Auth service reaches into the route layer   (minor)
  2 bugs filed during the run:
    4. BUG-004 critical  Preference toggles silently revert after save
    5. BUG-005 minor     Loading spinner flashes on fast responses
  1 failed task:
    6. TASK-013 Migrate legacy preference rows — migration is not idempotent

Findings and bugs from REQ-007 — approve which get repaired.
```

**If nothing was collected** — no findings, no open bugs, no failed tasks, which is the normal
outcome when review and tests were skipped as unnecessary or ran clean — **do not present an
empty menu.** Ask one short question instead, with the gate's own prompt:

```
REQ-011 — Guild plugin research writing: the run is complete.
  Nothing was collected — no findings, no bugs, no failed tasks.
  (Review: skipped, 2 of 4 reviewers; tests: checks only — see the plan's Assurance table.)

Confirm to close out: nothing to repair?
```

with `AskUserQuestion` options **Confirm — repair nothing** and **Hold**. Record it as the
approved-with-`none` decision below. The gate stays: a gate is the guild master's decision and is
never dropped, and `none` is how "approve, repair nothing" is said out loud. What you spare them is
the menu, not the decision.

**3. Ask with AskUserQuestion, as a MULTI-SELECT** — one option per numbered item ("Repair:
{item}"). They can approve some, all or none; "Other" covers anything they would rather
phrase differently.

**4. Record the decision, and create the repairs.** Two writes, always — setting `gate.status`
does **not** move the node:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
UPDATE guild_state SET value = 'orchestrator' WHERE key = 'actor';

UPDATE gate SET status = 'approved',
                decision = CAST(x'<hex-decision>' AS TEXT),
                decided_at = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now')
 WHERE node_id = 'REQ-NNN/gate-repairs' AND status = 'pending'
   AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM v_ready_nodes r WHERE r.id = 'REQ-NNN/gate-repairs')
RETURNING node_id, status;

UPDATE graph_node SET status = 'done'
 WHERE id = 'REQ-NNN/gate-repairs'
   AND (SELECT g.status FROM gate g WHERE g.node_id = graph_node.id) = 'approved'
RETURNING id, status;
```

**On `kumiai` this is one call** — `read_view v_ready_nodes where {id: "REQ-NNN/gate-repairs"}`
must return the row first, then `resolve_gate {node, status: "approved", decision}`, which
moves the gate and the node in one transaction — `done` on approve, `skipped` on reject
(`kumiai.md` §4 *Resolve a gate*).

- **The `v_ready_nodes` guard is not decoration.** Approving a gate whose predecessors have
  not finished makes `repair` ready immediately, and repairs would run against findings
  nobody produced.
- **`decision` is mandatory on this gate** — it *is* the fan-out. `none` is how you say
  "approve, repair nothing" out loud. Pass the user's own words through; six weeks later the
  reasoning is the part anyone wants.
- **On reject** (the run was wrong, not its findings): `status = 'rejected'` and the node goes
  to `'skipped'`. Say so and stop. A rejected gate may be decided again; an **approved** one
  may not — its successors have already been unblocked.

Then create one plain ticket per approved item (`task` + `task_capability`, per
`queries.md` §1), and link each repair to what it repairs:

```sql
UPDATE review_finding SET disposition = 'fixing', fix_task_id = 'TASK-021'
 WHERE id = 7 AND disposition = 'open' RETURNING id, disposition;
UPDATE bug SET status = 'fixing', fix_task_id = 'TASK-022'
 WHERE id = 'BUG-004' AND status = 'open' RETURNING id, status;
```

(kumiai: `create_task` carries the capabilities in the same call; then
`update_finding {id: 7, disposition: "fixing", fix_task: "TASK-021"}` and
`update_bug {key: "BUG-004", status: "fixing", expect_status: "open", fix_task: "TASK-022"}`.)

Go back to **3.1** — the approved gate makes `repair` ready. **There is no automatic
re-review.** If the user wants another pass later, that is a fresh reviewer ticket.

### 3.6 Requirement completion

When every node is `done` or `skipped`, confirm nothing is still open:

```sql
SELECT id, status, tasks_total, tasks_done, tasks_open, tasks_blocked, tasks_failed, title
  FROM v_requirement_progress WHERE id = 'REQ-NNN';
```

`tasks_open = 0` → `UPDATE requirement SET status = 'done' WHERE id = 'REQ-NNN' AND status <>
'done' RETURNING id, status;` (kumiai: `update_requirement`, then `update_project` /
`update_goal` for the roll-up) then roll the direction above it up — a project whose
requirements are all done is `done`, a goal whose projects are all done is `done` — then append
a bullet to `CHANGELOG.md` (3.9).

Closing a **sequential** project is what releases the next one in its goal, so re-read
`v_projects_runnable` after the roll-up: a project that was not runnable a moment ago may be
now, and that is the next thing to dispatch.

**`tasks_open` counts `blocked`, and that is the point.** `failed` was adjudicated at the
gate; `blocked` is a machine verdict nobody has looked at, and closing a requirement over one
ships un-attempted work silently. **Nothing in the schema stops you** — this is a
convention you honor. If a blocked task is holding a requirement open, say so by name; the
fix is recruiting (3.8), not a status edit.

List any `failed` tasks in the completion summary — they were judged at `gate-repairs`, so
they report rather than block.

Then summarize the requirement and ask: continue with the next one, or wrap up?

### 3.7 A requirement with no graph — the cursor fallback

A board that predates the graph falls back to the cursor (`v_next_task`, `v_batch`). Full
procedure: `references/edge-cases.md` § cursor fallback.

### 3.8 No eligible agent — block it, loudly

When the match in 3.3 comes back empty, that is a roster gap and it must be written down —
nothing else can make it visible. Full procedure, including the exact writes and the message
to the user: `references/edge-cases.md` § no eligible agent.

### 3.9 CHANGELOG maintenance

On requirement completion (3.6), append a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in the repo-root
`CHANGELOG.md`. Full format and the waived-task variant: `references/edge-cases.md` §
CHANGELOG maintenance.

---

## Step 4: Session wrap-up

When the cycle ends (the user stops, or nothing is actionable):

```
Session Summary
===============
Nodes run: {N}     Tickets completed: {N}     Bugs filed: {N}

Requirements:
  REQ-007: Session-backed authentication — in-progress, at gate-repairs
  REQ-008: Preferences page — in-progress (implement.ui running)

Next check-in, I'll continue with:
  REQ-007 — the repairs gate is ready for your decision
```

**The summary does not end without these three, when any is non-empty:**

- **Gates awaiting you** — `SELECT * FROM v_gates_pending`. The only thing on the board that
  cannot move without the user; it belongs at the top of the wrap-up, not the bottom.
- **Blocked work** — `v_blocked_tasks`. It never resolves on its own, and a `status-blocked`
  row whose `who` reads `needs:…` is a roster gap: that is an agent file waiting to be
  written.
- **Nodes left `failed` or `running`** — a `running` node with no live agent is a crash site
  and it holds everything behind it.

Then, and only then, stamp the check-in:

```sql
UPDATE guild_state SET value = strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ','now')
 WHERE key = 'last-checkin' RETURNING key, value;
```

(kumiai: `set_state {key: "last-checkin", value: "<now, ISO-8601 UTC>"}`.)

---

## Step 5: Verify against expectations

Before you hand the session back, run `guild:validate check-in` — the global invariants plus
§7 of `docs/expectations.md`, which asserts the four ways an orchestrator goes wrong:
dispatching by a hardcoded name, letting somebody else move a status, building past a gate,
and re-deriving a rule instead of reading the view. **Report every failure with its rows.**
Your own account of what you wrote is not evidence; the board is. On `kumiai`,
`guild:validate` runs it server-side as `check_invariants {process: "check-in"}`.

## Key Rules — at a glance

Each is argued in full where it first applies above; this is the checklist, not the argument.

1. The graph is the chain, and you do not know it — never invent an order, widen a batch,
   merge two, or dispatch a node the graph did not offer (§3.1–3.2).
2. You own every status transition, with no exceptions — `task`, `graph_node`, `gate`, and
   also `bug`, `plan`, `doc`, `inspection` and a finding's `disposition`. Agents report the
   outcome; you move it (3.4). Agents' board writes are content rows only — `work_log`,
   `review_finding`, new `bug` and `doc` rows, knowledge edges (Core model).
3. Record BOTH halves of every 3.4 row — ticket and node, always.
4. Two gates, and only one is yours: `gate-plan` (new-requirement's), `gate-repairs` (§3.5).
5. Problems are collected, not escalated — judged together at `gate-repairs` (§3.5).
6. The graph orders; `v_open_bounties` only names who could take a ticket, not whether it may
   run yet.
7. There is no reviewer fan-out to perform — the `review` node is four nodes, the member is
   the suffix of the node id (§3.3).
8. Read the view, do not re-derive the rule — the one exception is the agent match, whose
   single definition is §3.3.
9. Serial members are never concurrent; a batch that would hold two is stop-and-report, not
   something you quietly serialize (§3.2).
10. Subagents can't ask the user — relay through `NEEDS INPUT:`, `AskUserQuestion`, then
    `SendMessage` the answer back (§3.3).
11. A ticket names a capability; YOU name the member — honor a pin, else run §3.3 and dispatch
    rank 1, never invent or widen the superset test.
12. `blocked` means "no subagent available can take this bounty" and nothing else, written by
    you the moment the match fails (§3.8).
13. You never write an `agents/*.md` file — that happens only in `guild:new-requirement`, on
    the user's explicit answer.
14. Guard every mutation and read the `RETURNING` — one logical change per invocation, and
    zero rows back is information you act on.
