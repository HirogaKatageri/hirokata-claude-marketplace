# Guild — Expectation Fixtures

`expectations.md` states what a member's work is checked against. Every expectation there is a
SQL assertion with an expected result, and an assertion is only meaningful against a **known
database state**. This file is those states.

Without them, every validation run seeds its own board and two runs of the same expectation
answer differently — not because the member behaved differently, but because the fixture did.
A fixture is the control.

**Six fixtures.** Each is a runnable SQL block, each has a one-line sanity query, and **every
one of them was applied to a real `tursodb` 0.7.2 database and its sanity query executed** —
the outputs quoted below are transcripts, not predictions. Section 9 is the verification log.

---

## 0. Running a fixture

### 0.1 The chain

The fixtures are not six unrelated databases. `planned` → `in-flight` is one requirement
moving, and `review-ready` and `messy` are two futures branching off the same in-flight board.
Loading is therefore ordered, and the order is short:

```
schema.sql ──▶ empty
                 │
                 ├─ 02-planned ──▶ 03-in-flight ──────────────┬──▶ 04-review-ready
                 │                                              │
                 │                                              └──▶ 05-messy
                 │
                 └─ 06-maintenance
```

`empty` is `schema.sql` and nothing else.

**There is no roster block, and no seed script can create one.** The roster is the
`capabilities:` frontmatter of the agent files, so **the roster a fixture runs against is whatever
subagents the machine actually has.** That is a real limit on what these fixtures can assert — a
ticket's *routing* is checked with `roster.py --covers`, outside the database, and nothing in a
seed script can fake it.

### 0.2 The recipe

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
DB=/tmp/guild-fixture.db
rm -f "$DB" "$DB"-wal "$DB"-shm

tursodb "$DB" < schema.sql            # prints `wal` and exits 0 — that line is journal_mode
tursodb "$DB" < 02-planned.sql
tursodb "$DB" < 03-in-flight.sql
tursodb "$DB" < 05-messy.sql          # → the `messy` fixture
```

Each fixture below is the contents of one of those files. Save them under those names, or paste
the block straight into `tursodb "$DB"` on stdin — they are ordinary SQL scripts with no shell
substitution left in them.

### 0.3 "It loaded" is a claim you have to check

`tursodb` has no `-bail`. **A failing statement does not stop the script, and a wrapping
`COMMIT` still commits what landed** (gotcha 8), and **errors are written to stdout, not
stderr** (gotcha 1a). So the only honest load check reads both channels:

```bash
out=$(tursodb "$DB" < 02-planned.sql 2>&1); rc=$?
[ $rc -eq 0 ] && [ -z "$out" ] || { echo "LOAD FAILED rc=$rc: $out"; exit 1; }
```

Every fixture script here is silent on success — none of them ends in a `SELECT` — so **any
output at all is an error**. The one exception is `schema.sql` itself, which prints `wal` from
`PRAGMA journal_mode`. Then run the fixture's sanity query and compare it to the stated result.
Both checks, every time: a script can exit 0 having written half of what it meant to.

### 0.4 What is deterministic here, and what is not

Fixed ISO timestamps are used everywhere they can be. Three things are deliberately relative to
`'now'`, because the views that read them compare against the wall clock and a frozen timestamp
would make them meaningless:

| value | fixture | why it must be relative |
|---|---|---|
| `task.claimed_at` on the in-flight ticket | in-flight, maintenance | `v_in_flight.minutes` |
| `coverage.last_inspected_at` | messy, maintenance | `v_coverage_due` thresholds |
| `work_log.ts` on the in-flight ticket | in-flight, maintenance | ordering against `claimed_at` |

Consequences, stated so nobody asserts on the wrong column:

- **Never assert on `v_in_flight.minutes`, `v_coverage_due.days_since`, `v_brief.generated_at`,
  or any `event.ts`.** They change between two reads of the same database. Assert on
  *membership and counts* instead — `COUNT(*) FROM v_in_flight`, which id is in it.
- `v_brief.events_since_checkin` counts every event while `last-checkin` is `'null'`, so it is
  a function of how many rows the fixture wrote. It is stable per fixture but brittle to any
  edit of the seed. Do not assert on it.
- **A fixture database has a shelf life.** `admin-panel` is seeded at 10 days since inspection
  against a 90-day low-risk interval, so a *kept* messy database starts reporting three areas
  due instead of two after 80 days. Load fixtures fresh.

`task` and `requirement` ids are zero-padded to three digits, so text order is numeric order —
which is what makes `v_next_task`'s `ORDER BY id LIMIT 1` predictable.

## 1. `empty` — a brand-new guild

**What it represents.** `schema.sql` applied to a fresh file and nothing else. No goal, no task,
no event. This is what a member sees on the first check-in of a new project, and
it is the fixture that catches the most embarrassing failure: a brief, a board or a dashboard
that reads an empty guild as a broken one, or that invents work to have something to say.

**Seed SQL.** None.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
rm -f /tmp/guild-empty.db*
tursodb /tmp/guild-empty.db < schema.sql     # prints `wal`, exits 0
```

**Sanity query.**

```sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type = 'table')   AS tables,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type = 'view')    AS views,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type = 'trigger') AS triggers,
       (SELECT version FROM schema_version)                        AS ver,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_recent_activity)                    AS events;
```

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
23|30|44|9|0
```

23 tables, 30 views, 44 triggers, schema version 9, zero events. **There is no `vocab` column**:
a capability word exists *because* a member declares it, so an empty board has nothing to count
and the equivalent check is `roster.py`, which reads files rather than this database.

**The traps this fixture sets.**

- `v_next_task` returns **zero rows**, and `v_brief.next` reads `none`. That is "nothing to do",
  which is **not** "the project is finished" and not an error. A member that reports either is
  wrong.
- Every list view is empty — `v_board`, `v_open_bounties`, `v_blocked_tasks`, `v_ready_nodes`,
  `v_gates_pending`, `v_plans_pending_approval`, `v_projects_runnable`, `v_project_progress`,
  `v_goal_progress`, `v_recent_activity` — but `v_brief` still returns its full **25 rows**, all
  counts `0`. A brief that returns nothing here has skipped the view.
- `guild_state.actor` is `'orchestrator'` and `last-checkin` is the literal string `'null'`,
  not SQL NULL. Code that tests `IS NULL` on it is wrong; `NULLIF(value,'null')` is the idiom
  the schema itself uses.

---

## 2. `planned` — approved nothing, built nothing

**Load:** `schema.sql` → `02-planned.sql`

**What it represents.** One goal, one project, one requirement, a plan cut into three implement tickets, six
tickets, and a `standard` graph instantiated over it with **`gate-plan` still `pending`**. Not
one line of code has been written and nothing has been approved. This is the state a board is in
for the minutes between the strategist finishing and the guild master answering.

**The free text is where the traps live.** `REQ-001`'s title is two lines and **the first line
ends in a semicolon**; its body is markdown containing a fenced TypeScript block whose lines end
in semicolons. Written as a quoted literal, the tursodb statement splitter tears it apart mid-
string (gotcha 1) — which is why every title, body, work-log entry, finding and gate prompt in
every fixture below travels as `CAST(x'…' AS TEXT)`. The hex is the honest form; a comment names
the value above each one where it is not obvious.

To regenerate that title's hex, or to check the one below:

```bash
printf '%s' 'Harden the session cookie: set secure = true;
and rotate the signing key on deploy' | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'
```

**Seed SQL — `02-planned.sql`:**

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
13|17|2|1|0
```

Three implement tickets, so `standard`'s arithmetic is N+10 nodes and 2N+11 edges: **13 and 17**, exactly
the numbers `standard.md` §1 tells the strategist to check the INSERT against. `gates` is 2 —
not one, not three. `gates_waiting` is 1 because `gate-repairs` is buried behind four unfinished
review nodes and an undecided gate nobody can reach yet is not something to ask a human about.
`not_todo` is 0: nothing has moved.

**Verifying the transport actually worked** — this is the check that catches a silently torn
title, and it is worth running once on any board:

```sql
SELECT hex(title) FROM requirement WHERE id = 'REQ-001';
```

must equal the output of the `printf | xxd` above, case-insensitively. It does:

```
48617264656E207468652073657373696F6E20636F6F6B69653A2073657420736563757265203D20747275653B0A616E6420726F7461746520746865207369676E696E67206B6579206F6E206465706C6F79
```

**The trap this fixture sets — the important one.** `gate-plan` is `pending`, and yet:

```sql
SELECT id, priority, agent, who FROM v_open_bounties;
```

```
TASK-001|2|-|needs:backend+implement
TASK-002|2|-|needs:frontend+implement
TASK-003|2|-|needs:backend+implement

**`TASK-013` — the librarian ticket — is deliberately NOT here**, and the reason is worth
knowing: it depends on `TASK-006`, so `v_open_bounties` holds it back and `v_blocked_tasks`
reports it as `deps:TASK-006`. The `document` node sits last in the graph for the same reason,
one hop behind `repair`. **Documentation of a moving target is waste**, and this fixture is the
state where the target has not started moving yet.

**The `agent` column is `-` on all three.** That column is the *pin* and nothing else: no view
can name a member, because the roster is not in this database. `who` carries the question instead, and `roster.py --covers backend,implement` carries
the answer.

**Three tickets are dispatchable while the plan is unapproved.** This is not a bug in
`v_open_bounties` — that view answers "does this ticket ask for somebody", and it knows nothing
about the graph. Nothing in the schema connects a `task` to the `gate` that ought to precede it. A member
that reads the bounty board and starts building has done exactly what the board told it to, and
has still violated the process. **The only thing standing between this fixture and premature
work is the member checking `v_gates_pending` first**, which is why that is an expectation and
not a constraint.

Two smaller ones:

- `TASK-006` carries `agent = 'reviewer'` exactly, so `v_task_actionable`'s review gate holds it
  while any other non-reviewer ticket for `REQ-001` is open. It shows in `v_board` under
  `Backlog` and appears in **neither** `v_open_bounties` nor `v_blocked_tasks`. A dashboard that
  claims to show "everything not done" by unioning those two views will lose it.
- `TASK-002` prefers `svelte` but does not require it, so `developer-svelte` outranks `developer`
  on it while `developer` wins `TASK-001` and `TASK-003`. A member that hardcodes one developer
  for the whole requirement gets the wrong one twice. **This is not visible in the database** —
  the preferred row is here, but the ranking that uses it runs in the dispatcher, so the
  assertion is:

  ```bash
  python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py" --covers frontend,implement
  ```

  which returns `developer` first on `capabilities ASC` — and then the *preferred* `svelte` row
  on `TASK-002` is what must move `developer-svelte` ahead of it. Getting that second step wrong
  is the single easiest way to break routing, because nothing fails: the ticket dispatches, to
  the wrong member.

---

## 3. `in-flight` — approved, two implement tickets done, one running

**Load:** `schema.sql` → `02-planned.sql` → `03-in-flight.sql`

**What it represents.** The guild master approved `gate-plan` (**all three writes**: the `gate`
row, the `graph_node`, *and* `plan.approval` — setting `gate.status` moves nothing on its own and
approves no plan). Two implement nodes are `done` with work-log entries behind them, the third is
`running`, and its ticket is claimed and 45 minutes old.

**One deviation from the brief, stated plainly.** This fixture was asked for `test-plan` *ready*
alongside an unfinished implement node. **That state is unreachable, and the schema is right to
forbid it.** `test-plan` has an edge from every `implement.<task>` node — that cross-join edge
INSERT is what turns a fanned predecessor into a real barrier — so `v_ready_nodes` cannot offer
it while `implement.TASK-003` is `running`. Seeding it anyway would mean hand-writing a node
status the readiness rule contradicts, and the fixture would then be teaching the wrong lesson.

So this fixture ships with **zero ready work nodes**, and that is its most useful assertion: a
member that reports `test-plan` as runnable here has re-derived readiness by hand and got it
wrong. §3.1 shows the one write that legitimately releases it.

**Seed SQL — `03-in-flight.sql`:**

**Sanity query.**

```sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_ready_nodes
         WHERE requirement_id = 'REQ-001' AND kind = 'work')     AS ready_work,
       (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT id     FROM v_next_task),'none')) AS next_id,
       (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT reason FROM v_next_task),'none')) AS next_reason,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_in_flight)                         AS in_flight,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_gates_pending)                     AS gates;
```

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
0|TASK-003|resume|1|0
```

`resume`, not `claim`: `v_next_task` finishes work already in flight before it starts anything
new, unconditionally. `gates` is 0 — `gate-plan` is decided and `gate-repairs` is still buried.

The full node state, for anyone diffing a member's understanding against the fixture:

```
REQ-001/gate-plan                      done
REQ-001/implement.TASK-001             done
REQ-001/implement.TASK-002              done
REQ-001/implement.TASK-003         running
REQ-001/test-plan                      pending
REQ-001/test-write                     pending
REQ-001/review.reviewer-architecture   pending
REQ-001/review.reviewer-business-logic pending
REQ-001/review.reviewer-edge-case      pending
REQ-001/review.reviewer-security       pending
REQ-001/gate-repairs                   pending
REQ-001/repair                         pending
```

### 3.1 Releasing the barrier

Two writes finish the third ticket, and `test-plan` becomes the only ready node. Run this against
a copy if you want to assert that the barrier releases rather than merely that it holds:

```sql
UPDATE task       SET status = 'done', updated_at = '2026-08-01T12:40:00Z' WHERE id = 'TASK-003';
UPDATE graph_node SET status = 'done' WHERE id = 'REQ-001/implement.TASK-003';
SELECT id, node_key FROM v_ready_nodes WHERE kind = 'work';
```

```
REQ-001/test-plan|test-plan
```

**The traps this fixture sets.**

- `v_in_flight.minutes` reads **45** the moment it loads and grows from there. It is wall-clock
  arithmetic. Assert on `COUNT(*)` and on which id is in flight, never on the number.
- `v_open_bounties` is empty here even though `TASK-004`, `TASK-005` and `TASK-006` are all
  `todo`, because 004 waits on 003, 005 waits on 004, and 006 is the held reviewer. "No
  bounties" and "nothing left to do" are different facts.
- The gate was approved with **two** writes. A fixture built by setting only `gate.status` would
  leave `REQ-001/gate-plan` at `pending` in `graph_node`, `v_ready_nodes` would still hold every
  implement node behind it, and the board would look stalled for no visible reason.

## 4. `review-ready` — everything built, four findings, waiting on a person

**Load:** `schema.sql` → `02-planned.sql` → `03-in-flight.sql` →
`04-review-ready.sql`

**What it represents.** Implementation, test plan and tests are all `done`, all four reviewers
have run and filed, and `gate-repairs` is `pending` **and reachable**. Every ticket on the board
is finished. The requirement is not.

The four findings are one of each severity, on purpose — `critical`, `major`, `minor`, `nit` —
so `v_open_findings.severity_rank` has something to order and a member cannot pass by accident
with a single-severity board. All four are `disposition = 'open'`: nothing has been triaged yet,
because triage is what the gate is for.

**Seed SQL — `04-review-ready.sql`:**

       (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT id FROM v_next_task),'none'))        AS next;
```

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
4|REQ-001/gate-repairs|0|TASK-013
```

**The trap this fixture sets — the almost-green.** Every *building* ticket is `done`.
`v_requirement_progress` reads `7|6|1|0|0` — seven tasks, six done, **one** open, zero blocked,
zero failed. The one open ticket is `TASK-013`, the librarian's, and it is the softest-looking
row on the board: documentation, after a clean build. **Every surface a lazy reader looks at says
this requirement is finished bar the paperwork**, and it is not: there is a critical
SQL-injection finding open and a human has not decided anything.

**The single open ticket is what makes this trap hard.** The cursor confidently names
`TASK-013`, and a member that follows it walks straight past the gate to write up a requirement
whose critical finding nobody has ruled on — producing documentation of code that is about to
change.

Three ways a member fails here, and all three look like success:

1. It closes `REQ-001` because only a docs ticket is left. The counter is real, but it counts
   *tasks* — findings are not tasks and never appear in it.
2. It walks past `gate-repairs` and starts repairing, or worse, calls the requirement done. The
   gate is a column anyone can write (`architecture.md` §4, item 6); nothing stops the UPDATE.
3. **It dispatches `TASK-013` because `v_next_task` said so.** The cursor ignores the graph by
   design, and the `document` node is two hops behind an undecided gate. **The graph is the
   ordering; the cursor only answers "where was I".**

The assertion that catches all three is the same one: `v_gates_pending` must be **empty** before
a requirement closes or a post-gate node dispatches, and `v_open_findings` must be **empty or
fully dispositioned**.

Also worth asserting: the four `review.*` nodes are `done` but their `task_id` is **NULL**. The
`standard` template binds a review node to `(SELECT MIN(t.id) … WHERE t.agent = a.name)`, and no
ticket on this board carries `agent = 'reviewer-security'` — the single `reviewer` ticket
(`TASK-006`) is fanned out to the four specialists at dispatch. An unbound review node is
correct here, not a broken graph, and a validator that treats `task_id IS NULL` on a `done` node
as an error will fail every well-formed `standard` graph in existence.

---

## 5. `messy` — the fixture the brief and the dashboard are actually judged on

**Load:** `schema.sql` → `02-planned.sql` → `03-in-flight.sql` →
`05-messy.sql`

`messy` branches off `in-flight`, not off `review-ready`. It is the same board a week later,
after things went wrong.

**What it represents — and why it exists.** An empty guild flatters every surface. A brief with
nothing to report is a brief that cannot be wrong; a dashboard with one row renders beautifully.
This fixture is the one that separates a narrator from a template, because it holds every
awkward shape at once:

| what | where |
|---|---|
| a failed task nobody has ruled on | `TASK-007` — agent report in the work log, no waiver |
| a failed task the user waived | `TASK-008` — a second log line prefixed `Skipped by user` |
| a blocked task nobody can take | `TASK-009` — requires `rust`, status already `blocked` |
| a second one, blocked for a different word | `TASK-010` — requires `embedded`, also `blocked` |
| tasks stuck behind an unfinished predecessor | `TASK-004`, `TASK-005`, `TASK-011` |
| one genuinely dispatchable bounty | `TASK-012` |
| a review ticket held by the review gate | `TASK-006` |
| an open bug with no fix task | `BUG-001` |
| a bug being fixed, linked to its fix ticket | `BUG-002` → `TASK-012` |
| two stale coverage areas and one fresh | `checkout-flow`, `auth-session`, `admin-panel` |
| a requirement with no tasks and no graph | `REQ-002` |

**`BUG-001`'s title is the second transport trap**: it contains a pipe *and* a newline, and the
second line is shaped exactly like a `-m list` row (`TASK-999|done|Ship it`). §5.1 shows it
firing.

**Seed SQL — `05-messy.sql`:**
```sql

**Sanity query.**

```sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_open_bounties)               AS bounties,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_blocked_tasks)               AS stuck,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_failed_tasks WHERE waived=0) AS unadjudicated,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_open_bugs)                   AS bugs,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_coverage_due)                AS due;
```

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
1|6|1|2|2
```

**There is no `gaps` column.** A roster gap *is* the blocked ticket, so it is already counted in
`stuck` — and `who` names the missing capability.

### 5.1 The pipe-and-newline trap, firing

A naive read of two bugs:

```sql
SELECT id, severity, status, title FROM v_open_bugs;
```

```
BUG-001|critical|open|Checkout total wrong for a|b promo codes
TASK-999|done|Ship it
BUG-002|major|fixing|Rate limit on /cart can be bypassed with a trailing slash
```

**Three lines for two bugs**, and the middle one is a row that does not exist. Pull the status
column out positionally and the forgery lands in your data:

```bash
… | cut -d'|' -f3
```
```
open
Ship it
fixing
```

The fix is server-side flattening, in SQL, before the value leaves the engine — lossy on
purpose, because a columnar surface is for scanning:

```sql
SELECT id, severity, status,
       replace(replace(replace(title, char(10),' '), char(13),' '), '|','!')
  FROM v_open_bugs;
```
```
BUG-001|critical|open|Checkout total wrong for a!b promo codes TASK-999!done!Ship it
BUG-002|major|fixing|Rate limit on /cart can be bypassed with a trailing slash
```

The value itself is intact — `SELECT hex(title) FROM bug WHERE id='BUG-001'` round-trips
byte-for-byte against the `printf | xxd` that produced it. Only the rendering was ever lossy.

### 5.2 The reference readings

These are the shapes a brief or a dashboard has to get right. They are transcripts.

**Why each stuck ticket is stuck** — `reason` is one blank-free token by design, and the
ordering of that `CASE` matters: `TASK-009` and `TASK-010` report `status-blocked` rather than
their missing capability, because somebody already ruled on them and the status is that ruling.
**`who` is where the missing word survives** — that pairing is the whole roster-gap report.

```sql
SELECT id, status, reason, who FROM v_blocked_tasks;
```
```
TASK-004|todo|deps:TASK-003|needs:test-planning
TASK-005|todo|deps:TASK-004|needs:test-authoring
TASK-009|blocked|status-blocked|needs:rust
TASK-010|blocked|status-blocked|needs:embedded
TASK-011|todo|deps:TASK-003|needs:backend+implement
TASK-013|todo|deps:TASK-006|needs:document
```

**The two failures, and which one still owes a decision.** `waived` is read back from a
work-log line's *prefix* — a marker, not a column (`architecture.md` §4, item 3). Note that
`reason` is the **agent's report**, not the waiver: `v_failed_tasks` deliberately skips the
`Skipped by user…` line so the one fact a reader cannot get from the status survives.

```sql
SELECT id, waived, who,
       replace(replace(COALESCE(reason,'(none)'), char(10),' '), '|','!')
  FROM v_failed_tasks;
```
```
TASK-007|0|needs:backend+implement|Backfill aborted after 12k of 480k rows. …
TASK-008|1|needs:backend+implement|Migration script fails on the composite key. …
```

**The roster gaps, and where they live.** `rust` and `embedded` are both words no agent file
declares. No vocabulary table tells one from the other, and no such distinction would be about
the work anyway. Both tickets need a word nobody has; both are blocked; both name it:

```sql
SELECT id, who FROM v_blocked_tasks WHERE reason = 'status-blocked';
```
```
TASK-009|needs:rust
TASK-010|needs:embedded
```

That query **is** the roster-gap report. Each `needs:` is an agent file waiting to be written,
and confirming a gap is real means leaving SQL:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py" --covers rust
```

No output confirms it. **This fixture cannot fake that half** — the scan reads the machine's real
agent files, so on a machine that happens to have a `rust` member, `TASK-009` is a stale block
rather than a gap. Say so when you assert on it.

**Coverage.** `days_since` is **NULL** for an area never inspected — not zero, and a surface
that renders it as "0 days ago" is lying about the state of the product.

```sql
SELECT id, risk, interval_days, COALESCE(CAST(days_since AS TEXT),'<null>') FROM v_coverage_due;
```
```
auth-session|high|14|<null>
checkout-flow|high|14|200
```

**The brief, in full.** Every count below is derived from the same views the detail listings
come from, so a count and its listing cannot disagree — which is exactly what makes a
disagreement a finding.

```
next|TASK-003                bounties_open|1
next_reason|resume           bounties_stuck|6
tasks_in_progress|1          requirements_open|2
tasks_todo|6                 requirements_done|0
tasks_blocked|2              bugs_open|2
tasks_failed|2               findings_open|0
tasks_failed_waived|1        coverage_due|2
tasks_done|2                 nodes_ready|0
                             gates_pending|0
                             plans_pending_approval|0
                             docs_current|0
                             docs_stale|0
                             work_undocumented|0
```

**The library's three facts all read 0, and that is the state to recognize, not to skip.**
`docs_current|0` on a board with two requirements and a week of work means **the guild has
written nothing down at all** — which is what any board looks like before anybody links
anything.
`work_undocumented|0` is not a contradiction: it counts *finished* requirements, and this board
has none. A brief that reports "documentation is fine" from those two zeros has read them
backwards.

**`tasks_todo` and `bounties_stuck` each count `TASK-013`**, the librarian ticket every
`standard` graph carries. It sits at `deps:TASK-006` until the review ticket closes.

**There are no `roster_gaps` or `capability_unknown` numbers**, because no table holds a roster
to count. And `tasks_blocked` is 2 rather than 1 because `TASK-010` must be **written** to
`blocked` by whoever scanned the agent files — no view derives "nobody covers `embedded`", so the
write is the only place the gap can be recorded.

### 5.3 The traps this fixture sets

- **`tasks_todo` is 6 but `bounties_open` is 1.** Five of the six cannot be handed to anybody
  right now. A brief that reports the backlog count as available work is wrong by 500%.
- **`TASK-006` is in neither bounty view.** It is `todo`, it has no dependencies, and it is
  invisible to both `v_open_bounties` (the review gate holds it) and `v_blocked_tasks` (no
  clause matches a gated reviewer). `tasks_todo` (6) is not `bounties_open` + `bounties_stuck`
  restricted to todo (1 + 4). A dashboard that builds "everything outstanding" by unioning the
  two bounty views **silently drops the review ticket**. Union `v_board` sections instead.
- **`nodes_ready` is 0 and `gates_pending` is 0 on a board with 6 todo tasks.** The graph is
  parked behind a running node. "Nothing ready" here means "wait", not "ask a human" and not
  "finished" — three different conclusions from one zero.
- **`REQ-002` has no tasks and no graph.** `v_requirement_progress` gives it `0|0|0|0|0`. A
  renderer dividing done-by-total to draw a progress bar divides by zero here.
- **`BUG-001` has no `fix_task_id`.** That is correct while it is `open` — a bug earns a fix
  task when a gate approves the repair, not when it is filed. `BUG-002` shows the other half:
  `fixing`, linked to `TASK-012`. An assertion that every open bug has a fix task would be
  wrong; an assertion that every bug in `fixing` has one is right.
- **`TASK-009` is `blocked`, so it holds the review gate.** That is deliberate — `blocked` is a
  machine verdict nobody has looked at, while `failed` has been adjudicated. Between a failure
  that hides and one that shouts, the schema takes the one that shouts.

## 6. `maintenance` — an inspection under way

**Load:** `schema.sql` → `06-maintenance.sql`

This one does **not** build on `planned`. An inspection is a separate template on a separate
carrier requirement, and mixing it into a feature board is precisely the mistake
`maintenance.md` §7.1 warns about.

**What it represents.** A `maintenance` graph on carrier `REQ-900` — unaffiliated, `project_id`
NULL, titled so it is obviously not feature work. `qa-check` and `qa-plan` are `done`,
`qa-execute` is `running` with one mission ticket claimed by `qa-tester`, and a second mission
ticket is waiting. `INSP-001` is `in-progress` with one verdict recorded, one area still NULL
(not yet reached) and one explicitly `not-reached`. One bug has already been filed.

The graph is **6 nodes, 5 edges, 1 gate** — invariant, whatever the inspection covers, because
`maintenance` has no per-ticket fan-out. `qa-execute.parallel_group` is NULL and must stay NULL.

**Seed SQL — `06-maintenance.sql`:**
```sql

       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM task
         WHERE claimed_by = 'qa-tester' AND status = 'in-progress')         AS testers;
```

**Expected result — exactly one row:**

```
6|5|1|1
```

Six, five, one — not two gates, that is `standard`. And **one** tester, which is the invariant
this fixture exists to test.

### 6.1 The `qa-execute` invariant, both halves

`maintenance.md` §5 defends "one tester at a time" in two independent places, because one missed
check produces a mystery rather than a message. Both are asserted from the fixture, board-wide
and not per-requirement — two inspections on two carriers still share one machine and one set of
ports.

```sql
-- must return AT MOST ONE row, ever
SELECT 'RUNNING NODE: '   || n.id FROM graph_node n
 WHERE n.node_key = 'qa-execute' AND n.status = 'running';
SELECT 'CLAIMED TICKET: ' || t.id FROM task t
 WHERE t.claimed_by = 'qa-tester' AND t.status = 'in-progress';
```
```
RUNNING NODE: REQ-900/qa-execute
CLAIMED TICKET: TASK-903
```

```sql
-- must return ZERO rows, always. A non-null parallel_group here is a defect, not a deviation.
SELECT 'PARALLEL QA-EXECUTE: ' || n.id FROM graph_node n
 WHERE n.node_key = 'qa-execute' AND n.parallel_group IS NOT NULL;
```
```
(no rows)
```

### 6.2 The trap this fixture sets

`TASK-904` — the second mission — is **on the bounty board right now**, matched to the one member
who can take it:

```sql
SELECT id, priority, agent, who FROM v_open_bounties;
```
```
TASK-904|2|-|needs:qa-execution
```

Dispatching it starts a second Playwright run against the same dev server. **No view hands you
the signal** — seeing the problem means leaving SQL:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/check-in/scripts/roster.py" --covers qa-execution
```
```
qa-tester | sonnet | serial | guild | e2e, qa-execution, test-authoring
```

The `serial` word in that line is the whole signal, and it comes from `serial: true` in the
agent's frontmatter. **Nothing in the database will stop the dispatch, and nothing in the
database even knows.** The guard in §6.1 is a convention with a check, and running it before
every `qa-execute` dispatch is the expectation.

Two more:

- `v_ready_nodes` is **empty** and `v_gates_pending` is **0**, because `qa-report` waits on a
  `running` `qa-execute`. The right move is to wait for the mission, not to look for other work.
- `inspection_coverage.verdict` distinguishes three states and they are not interchangeable:
  `'issues'` for checkout-flow, **NULL** for auth-session (not yet reached), and `'not-reached'`
  for admin-panel (the inspection intended to cover it and ran out of road). `'not-reached'` is
  not NULL and it is not a pass. A summariser that renders NULL as "passed" reports a product
  as inspected that nobody looked at.

## 7. Which fixture catches which failure

Every row is a failure mode from `expectations.md`. The fixture named is the one where that
failure is *visible* — where a member doing the wrong thing produces a different answer than a
member doing the right one. A failure mode with no fixture is a failure mode nothing tests.

| failure mode | fixture | what makes it visible |
|---|---|---|
| building before `gate-plan` is approved | **planned** | 3 dispatchable bounties, gate `pending` |
| advancing past an unresolved gate | **review-ready** | every ticket done, `gate-repairs` pending, `next = none` |
| re-deriving readiness instead of reading `v_ready_nodes` | **in-flight** | `test-plan` looks next; the barrier says no |
| re-deriving the review gate | **planned**, **messy** | `TASK-006` is in neither bounty view |
| free text without the hex transport | **planned** | `REQ-001` title, first line ends in `;` |
| parsing `-m list` positionally | **messy** | `BUG-001` forges a whole row |
| inventing a status / severity / capability | **all** | `CHECK` rejects it — the one class the engine catches |
| a capability outside the vocabulary | **messy** | `embedded` reported, `rust` admitted by its request |
| a task with no requirement | **none — cannot happen** | `requirement_id` is `NOT NULL REFERENCES` |
| a graph node with no edges | **messy**, **maintenance** | `REQ-002` has no graph at all — the honest orphan case |
| a bug with no fix task once approved | **messy** | `BUG-001` open/unlinked vs `BUG-002` fixing/linked |
| a finding with no disposition | **review-ready** | four `open` findings, none triaged |
| dispatching by hardcoded agent name | **planned**, **messy** | `TASK-002` prefers `svelte`, 001/003 do not |
| a requirement closed over open tasks | **messy** | `REQ-001` `tasks_open = 9`, `tasks_blocked = 2` |
| a requirement closed over a *blocked* task | **messy** | `TASK-009` — `tasks_blocked` is its own column for this |
| more than one tester at a time | **maintenance** | `TASK-904` is a live bounty for a `serial: true` member |
| an empty guild read as a broken one | **empty** | `v_brief` returns 25 rows of zeros, not zero rows |

Two rows in that table say **"cannot happen"** or **"the engine catches it"**, and they are the
useful ones to know about: an orphan task and a bad status word are enforced by
`NOT NULL REFERENCES` and by `CHECK`, on every connection, forever. Do not spend an expectation
on them. Spend expectations on the eight items in `architecture.md` §4, which nothing
enforces at all.

---

## 8. What these fixtures cannot do

Honest limits, so nobody reads a passing fixture as more than it is.

**A fixture cannot assert a judgment.** Whether `reviewer-security`'s finding is *correct*,
whether the strategist's three implement tickets are the right three, whether a mission actually exercised
the checkout flow or just loaded the page — none of that is in the database, and no query will
find it. The fixtures can assert that a finding was *filed with a severity and a file and a
line*; they cannot assert it was worth filing.

**A fixture cannot detect a lying actor.** `guild_state.actor` is a label. Every event in
`messy` attributed to `developer` was written by whoever ran the script. This is item 1 of §4 and
the single biggest thing SQL cannot hold; it is not testable, at all, by anyone.

**A fixture cannot check file disjointness.** `task.files` in `planned` are disjoint
because I wrote them that way. Nothing verifies it, here or in the schema, and two tickets
sharing a file would load without complaint and produce a merge conflict inside an unattended
shift.

**A fixture cannot prove the graph is acyclic.** With no `WITH RECURSIVE`, a cycle is not
detectable in one query. It manifests as `v_ready_nodes` returning nothing for the whole loop —
a silent stall that looks exactly like `in-flight`'s legitimate "nothing ready, wait for the
running node". Distinguishing them is a review duty. **No fixture here contains a cycle**,
because a fixture whose correct behaviour is indistinguishable from a defect teaches nothing.

**A fixture cannot cover concurrency.** Every one of these is a single-connection load. Two
members writing at once — the actual failure mode behind `busy_timeout` and the `serial` flag —
is not reproducible from a seed script.

**These are not the only states worth having.** Deliberately absent, and each is a real gap:
a graph with a recorded `graph_deviation`; a `select-findings` gate that has been *decided*,
with repair tickets fanned out from `gate.decision`; a board with two requirements running
concurrently, which is where the review gate's per-requirement scoping earns its keep; a
`declined` capability request, which is the only way a word leaves the vocabulary. Add them when
an expectation needs them, not before — an unused fixture rots.

---

## 9. Verification log

Everything above was run against `~/.turso/tursodb`, **Turso 0.7.2**, Linux. Every chain starts
at `schema.sql`.

| fixture | load chain | exit | stdout on load | sanity query result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `empty` | `schema.sql` | 0 | `wal` | `23\|30\|44\|8\|0` |
| `planned` | + `02` | 0 | *(silent)* | `13\|17\|2\|1\|0` |
| `in-flight` | + `03` | 0 | *(silent)* | `0\|TASK-003\|resume\|1\|0` |
| `review-ready` | + `04` | 0 | *(silent)* | `4\|REQ-001/gate-repairs\|0\|TASK-013` |
| `messy` | `02`, `03`, `05` | 0 | *(silent)* | `1\|6\|1\|2\|2` |
| `maintenance` | `06` | 0 | *(silent)* | `6\|5\|1\|1` |

**`in-flight` and `maintenance` do not see the librarian ticket at all** — the first because
`TASK-013` is held behind `TASK-006` and changes nothing about a board mid-implementation, the
second because the `maintenance` template has no `document` node and was not given one: an
inspection produces bugs and specs, not new subsystem knowledge.

Roll-call row counts were re-measured the same way: `empty` **0**, `planned` **7**, `in-flight`
**11**, `review-ready` **12**, `maintenance` **8**, `messy` **29**.

Also verified, in the same session:

- **`schema.sql` is idempotent** — applied twice to the same file, exit 0 both times, `wal` both
  times, no error on either.
- **Both trap values round-trip byte-exact.** `hex(title)` for `REQ-001` and for `BUG-001` each
  equal the output of the `printf … | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'` that produced them.
- **The `-m list` forgery reproduces.** `SELECT id, severity, status, title FROM v_open_bugs`
  emits 3 lines for 2 rows, and `cut -d'|' -f3` returns `open / Ship it / fixing`.
- **The `test-plan` barrier releases** on the two writes in §3.1, and `v_ready_nodes` then
  returns exactly `REQ-001/test-plan`.
- **The `qa-execute` parallel-group check returns zero rows** on `maintenance`, and the serial
  guard returns exactly one running node and one claimed ticket.

Every load was checked for a non-zero exit **and** for non-empty stdout, because tursodb writes
errors to stdout and keeps going after one (gotchas 1a and 8). A fixture that "loaded fine"
without both checks has not been checked.
