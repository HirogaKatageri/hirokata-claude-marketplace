# Shared reviewer procedure — reading context, filing findings, reporting completion

Common to all four review agents (`reviewer-architecture`, `reviewer-security`,
`reviewer-business-logic`, `reviewer-edge-case`). Substitute your own name everywhere
`{reviewer-name}` appears. Each reviewer's own file carries only what differs: the "You will
also be given" framing, its Step 2 review criteria, its severity descriptions, and its
domain-specific "don't review X" lines.

## Step 1: Read Your Context

You will be given a **TASK ID**. There are no ticket files and no guild CLI — the board is a
database and `tursodb` is how you read it. **Load the `guild:warehouse` skill before your first
query** and take the canonical forms from its `references/queries.md`.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.turso:$PATH"
DB=.guild/guild.db          # cloud boards: see the skill's Connect section
T=TASK-NNN

# each of these selects ONE column, so the whole of stdout IS the value — byte-exact,
# with no separator the driver could insert into it
printf "SELECT objective FROM task WHERE id='$T';\n"        | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
printf "SELECT body FROM requirement WHERE id='REQ-NNN';\n" | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
printf "SELECT body FROM plan WHERE id='PLAN-NNN';\n"       | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

**Backend.** Read `backend:` in `.guild/config.yaml` — absent means `local`, and the dispatch
prompt names it too. Every SQL block on this page is the local path. On `kumiai` the board is a
Kumiai workspace: use the `mcp__kumiai__*` tools per `guild:warehouse` → `references/kumiai.md`,
pass `workspace` from the config and your own name as `actor`, send free text as plain strings
(no hex), and never open `.guild/guild.db`. If no `mcp__kumiai__*` tool is available to you,
report failed and say so — never fall back to `tursodb`. The calls:

- read: `get task` (its `objective`), `get requirement`, `get plan`; the sibling tickets are
  `list task where {requirement_id}`, their test plans `list plan where {requirement_id,
  task_id}`, and what is already filed `list review_finding where
  {task_id: [...]}` (§0)
- write each finding: `add_finding {task: "$T", severity, summary, detail, file, line}` — the
  reviewer is your `actor`, the result's `id` is the finding (§2); then `log_work`. Never move a
  status

**Scope your reading to the tickets that asked for review.** The plan's `## Assurance` table (and
each ticket's `## Assurance` lines) records, per ticket, whether review is `full`, `focused` on
named lenses, or `none`. You are running because your lens was kept for at least one ticket. Review
**only** those tickets and leave the rest alone — they were assessed and need no second reader.
Your lens is also the limit of your brief: a `focused` ticket that kept `reviewer-business-logic`
and `reviewer-edge-case` is not asking you, as the security reviewer, for an opinion.

**Scope your reading to the diff.** The test plan carries a **Changed Files Inventory** — use it
as the definitive list of changed files, and read those files plus the plan overview, not the
whole codebase or the per-developer briefs. The test-planner puts the plan in its test-writer
ticket's `objective`, so find that ticket, then read it:

```bash
printf "SELECT json_object('id',t.id,'status',t.status,'title',t.title)
   FROM task t
  WHERE t.requirement_id='REQ-NNN'
    AND (t.node_key = 'test-plan'
         OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM task_capability c
                     WHERE c.task_id = t.id AND c.capability = 'test-authoring'))
  ORDER BY t.id;\n" | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"

printf "SELECT objective FROM task WHERE id='TASK-MMM';\n" | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

It comes back as JSON for a reason: `-m list` is pipe-separated with no quoting, and a title
containing a newline forges an entire row that reads as completely legitimate. **Never split a
listing that carries free text on `|` yourself.**

The test plan is also a `plan` row written FOR that ticket, if one exists:

```bash
printf "SELECT body FROM plan WHERE requirement_id='REQ-NNN' AND task_id='TASK-MMM';\n" \
  | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

If there is no test plan at all (bug-fix flow), fall back to the completed developer tickets'
work logs for the changed-file list:

```bash
printf "SELECT json_object('task',task_id,'agent',agent,'entry',entry)
   FROM work_log
  WHERE task_id IN (SELECT id FROM task
                     WHERE requirement_id='REQ-NNN' AND status='done')
  ORDER BY task_id, id;\n" | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

## Step 3: Write Findings

**File each finding as a `review_finding` row** — one INSERT per finding. These are structured
rows (severity, file, line), and the orchestrator reads them back from `v_open_findings`:

```bash
sum=$(printf '%s' "{one line: what is wrong}" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n')
det=$(printf '%s' "{what was expected, what happens, and how to fix it}" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n')
{ printf "PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;\n"
  printf "INSERT INTO review_finding
            (task_id, reviewer, severity, summary, detail, file, line, created_at)
          SELECT t.id, '{reviewer-name}', 'critical|major|minor|nit',
                 CAST(x'$sum' AS TEXT), CAST(x'$det' AS TEXT),
                 '{path}', {N}, strftime('%%Y-%%m-%%dT%%H:%%M:%%SZ','now')
            FROM task t WHERE t.id='$T' RETURNING id;\n"
} | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

Four things about that statement:

- **Summary and detail cross as hex.** Your detail quotes code, code lines end in `;`, and a `;`
  that ends a line ends the statement — even inside an open string literal. Hex is always one
  line, so the splitter cannot tear it. Never `echo`; never round-trip the value through `$( )`.
- **`FROM task t WHERE t.id='$T'` IS the referential check.** A bad task id yields zero rows and
  no partial write, which matters because a failing statement does not stop the script.
- **`file` and `line` are nullable** — pass `NULL, NULL` for a finding with no single location.
- **`severity` is CHECKed by the database.** Anything outside `critical | major | minor | nit` is
  refused outright rather than quietly vanishing from every view at once.

You do **not** set `guild_state.actor` for a finding: the trigger takes the event's actor from
the `reviewer` column, because a finding's author is the most important fact about it. Put your
own name there and nothing else.

**Then log your verdict** — one `work_log` row, so the orchestrator can consolidate the four
verdicts without parsing findings:

```bash
v=$(printf '%s' "Verdict: {PASS | ISSUES FOUND} — {N} finding(s). Clean: {areas checked that were fine}." \
    | xxd -p | tr -d '\n')
{ printf "PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;\n"
  printf "INSERT INTO work_log (task_id, ts, agent, entry)
          SELECT t.id, strftime('%%Y-%%m-%%dT%%H:%%M:%%SZ','now'), '{reviewer-name}',
                 CAST(x'$v' AS TEXT)
            FROM task t WHERE t.id='$T' RETURNING id;\n"
} | tursodb -q -m list "$DB"
```

**You write your rows straight into the board.** All four reviewers run concurrently, and that
is fine: findings are separate rows and the work log is append-only, so you never contend for
the same row. Two writers can still collide on the database itself, which surfaces as a
non-zero exit with the error text on **stdout**, not stderr. Check the exit code and retry once.
Silence is not success — a successful INSERT with no `RETURNING` also prints nothing, which is
why every mutation above carries one.

## Step 4: Report Completion

Do NOT declare `Fix:` follow-up tickets and do NOT manage review rounds yourself. The findings
you file are **collected, not escalated** — they wait at the requirement's `gate-repairs` gate,
where the guild master judges them against each other in one pass and picks which become repair
work. Your only job is accurate `review_finding` rows plus one clearly-labeled verdict line.

Report completion in your final message (e.g. PASS/FAIL or done).

**Do NOT set any status or move your ticket — the orchestrator owns status transitions, and
nothing enforces that.** `UPDATE task SET status = 'done'` is one statement any connection can
run, and `guild_state.actor` is a label the triggers copy verbatim, not an identity. The rule
holds only because you keep it. The same goes for `review_finding.disposition` and
`fix_task_id` — those move when the gate is decided, not when you file the row.

## What NOT to Do — common to all four

- Don't fix code, and don't declare `Fix:` follow-up tickets — the orchestrator derives
  candidate fixes from your findings and only creates tickets the user approves.
- Don't disposition your own findings (`open → fixing | fixed | waived`) — that is the gate's
  decision, recorded after a human makes it.
- Don't write to `event` by hand — the triggers write it.
- Don't modify source files.
